It sent Tesla\u2019s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.\n\nWall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: \u201cOur estimate for Tesla\u2019s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,\u201d In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That\u2019s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark\u2019s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: \u201cIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.\u201d A $3,000 share price would put Tesla\u2019s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nSince Ark\u2019s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk\u2019s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla\u2019s stock price. He believes that \u201cif executed really well\u201d, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/)",

        "post_text": "Parted with TSLA this week after holding for 5 years. Here's why. Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.\n\nBeing a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' \n\nHowever, there has been a change. Things with Elon have certainly become more radical and it seems that every single day there is a new headline that is slowly destroying the brand. Now, before we get into the whole \"but Elon isn't Tesla!\" let me tell you the incredible importance of consumer sentiment and branding. \n\nI do not imagine Tesla ever being divorced from Elon Musk. When you think \"Tesla\" you cannot escape thinking \"Elon Musk.\" It is like trying to think about Microsoft without thinking or mentioning Bill Gates or some other strong brand-to-noun association. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and search Tesla now and see what comes up. Headline after headline is about Musk. This is not good for the brand, especially considering their consumer segment is actively being isolated. \n\nNow, one must ask: why do people buy things? There's a wide array of reasons, but I believe fundamentally it boils down to the value and reputation of the product. The value has a mix of factors that range from price, functionality, importance, etc. and reputation can be understood as how the brand is perceived, how the consumer is perceived as a result of owning the product, and how the consumer feels owning the product. This is where I lose the belief in the growth potential despite the positioning. Simply put, I do not think consumers are going to feel good about buying a Tesla with the negativity surrounding Elon. \n\nA mere year ago, if a person bought a Tesla or owned a Tesla, what would this say about a person? How would that person feel about that purchase? Tesla was the cool, sophisticated brand that was essentially symbolic of changing the world. Just look at Tesla's mission statement: \"Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. Tesla is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.\" \n\nWhere is this brand now? How would a person feel now? Ask yourself, if someone pulled up in a Tesla what would you think about them? What feelings would it invoke?\n\nOften times, we want to distance ourselves from feelings and sentiment and put an enormous emphasis on reason, facts, and data. This is not necessarily wrong, but this is certainly also not unique to the financial realm and TSLA has a history of this as well. We had people putting in orders for vehicles that were not being produced, people YOLOing their life savings into the stock because they believed in the future growth of the company before the company was seriously competitive, an unprecedented cult-like following that boosted the stock and gave the company an incredible amount of capital, and so on. Yet, when we look at TSLA now and think about the projected growth, why think people will actually want to continue to buy this product? Who is going to spend the money of a luxury vehicle to suddenly be associated with a person that people are increasingly viewing in a negative way? Not me. Apparently not my friends or co-workers either who were previously considering a Tesla and now want nothing to do with it. And apparently not my friend who is a Tesla owner and is starting to feel embarrassed for driving one. We can talk about how \"dumb\" these people are, but we cannot escape these are legitimate and valid sentiments toward the brand that have real costs associated with them.  \n\nThe sentiment cannot be captured in a graph right now. You have no data points on the would-be consumers because they are now never-were consumers. This data is only going to show in their sales. If sales continue to go up, then it seems reasonable to say that consumer sentiment has not reached a level where people feel so negatively about the product that they stopped buying. What I am suggesting here is that it my belief that this will inevitably happen because of the intimate link between Tesla and Elon. Tesla could get a new CEO, change leadership, etc., but I do not see them escaping this link and I believe it will ultimately be the detriment to the brand. Sales will not completely stop, but the growth projections that the stock relied heavily on I believe will certainly slow a lot sooner than shareholders anticipated and if it ever does reach previous target prices of $250+, this will not be for a long time. \n\nI'm not bullish or bearish on the stock. I do not think the company is going to suddenly vanish and the stock will drop to <$50 (at least I hope not for many of the investors I know). However, I also do not think the growth will be as aggressive as it once could have been and this is going to limit the stock in many ways. If we factor in slowed growth from the recession, one must keep in mind that this is just more time for Elon to further damage the brand between now and when people are in better buying conditions. What's next? Apparently removing Twitter's suicide prevention feature. Maybe tomorrow it's denying climate change and next month will be another stock sell off after yet another promise of not doing so. Though, ultimately, this is no longer my problem. The integrity of my financial future is no longer jeopardized by a guy that is becoming increasingly unhinged without the board properly exercising their duty to act in the interest of shareholders.\n\nMy thoughts on being a TSLA investor is what my mother used to say: it's been real, it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun.",

        "post_text": "Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target' \nOn Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.\n\nTesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.\n\nPreviously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.\n\nIn light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.\n\nThe revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.\n\nMoreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.\n\nThis inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.\n\nJPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.\n\n\nFull article https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/jpmorgan-cuts-tesla-stock-price-target-on-weak-deliveries-93CH-3364609",

Two weeks ago I received a $250k check from a house we sold.  It'll be a while before we need it, so I thought- what the hell- I should be able to make a quick buck instead of just leaving it in savings.  I deposited it to my brokerage account and I tried to buy 225 shares of TSLA at $1,115 or so thinking it would go back to $1200 in no time.  My broker blocked the sale because of the waiting period before I could use the funds.  I watched as the price went up a little bit so I was pissed.. then I watched it go down and down and down.. so even thought I could trade, I waited instead.  \n\nTLTR: My broker saved me from at least a $60k error because I couldn't use the funds when I wanted to.",

The market cap increased from $864B to the $1.1T in 4 days.  That's a total of $236B increase in less than a week. The four day increase alone is worth more than Ford, GM, Nissan, and Honda total market caps combined ($67B, $79B, $22B, & $54B respectively).  Four days....it increased by the size of some of the largest car producers in the US combined.  It's total market cap is nearly 5X those same companies combined (you could own each of them 5X with TSLA market cap).\n\nAll of that for a company that has less than $4b in operational income YTD, which by the way is about 8X less than the combined income generated by the aforementioned car producers.  To also put that into perspective, it is now worth more than Facebook by $150B (that's a whole AMD market cap) which has generated 10X the net income YTD.\n\nI'm not a bear or a bull, I'm just watching this from the sidelines at this point.  I just wanted to point out how crazy that is.",

        "post_text": "We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA) \\*\\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\\*\\*\n\nOver the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen\n\nDespite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3\u2019 2023.\n\nHowever, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla\u2019s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla\u2019s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla\u2019s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla\u2019s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla\u2019s current offerings as well as Tesla\u2019s future capabilities.\n\nThe Cybertruck further highlights Tesla\u2019s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla\u2019s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla\u2019s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, \"so off the hook, you can\u2019t even see the hook.\u201d EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck\u2019s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla\u2019s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that \u201cWe dug our own grave\u201d when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.",

The virtual boy was in the 90s and we just now have real VR. And it\u2019s still not perfect.\n\nThe problem is unlike big tech Tesla doesn\u2019t print money that they can throw at a moon shot forever.\n\nI think Tesla returning to facebook even when Elon owns its rival is a huge red flag. Remember he swore it off before even buying Twitter and the dude is notorious for being one of the most stubborn people on the planet.\n\nNot to mention, it reeks of desperation that he is claiming he wants to resort to the same tactics used by sellers of time shares to sell FSD\u2026 basically forcing people through a demo before they get their car.\n\nI feel it\u2019s a huge omen.",

After months of weighing options I decided this was the best move for my family.\n\n      I've been in TSLA since 2015 when I decided to invest as a single mother,  and never sold even when times were hard. TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!\n \n        I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     \n       So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.\n\n      Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.\n\n        Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I've decided to just not let myself think on those terms.\n     \n \n       I now feel a security in knowing that if it rises, I still have half my holdings and will enjoy watching my position climb again.  And if it goes down, I will have the option to buy the dip.\n\n       I was surprised at how stubborn my pride was when deciding whether to reduce position or not!   This ride has been wild over the years.\n\n      I'm happy to still be on it! But happy I was able to exercise making a tough decision that I knew was the wisest, for me.\n\nUPDATE:. After this most recent split, I am now at 150 shares and will use my earnings from last year's sell  to purchase 50 more shares.",

You have to be expecting growth in sectors and markets not yet accessed by the company. That is eminently possible but with no information there is no reasonable way to estimate it. Your error bars are too large to create a valid result.\n\nYou also have to hope that the expected competition coming to the company's current sectors won't cause existing growth to slow. And that's not going to happen. Every car maker on Earth is coming for the EV market, because manufacturing most kinds of ICE cars is going to be banned in the future, and they want to remain in business, and will not find it hard to do so.\n\nBottom line: if Tesla doesn't start to access new business lines (robotics is a good example) it will start to get its ass kicked in EV, and it will collapse and be remembered as a fad.\n\nThat's all the certainty there is. It may go up, but it will certainly go down if it doesn't start reinventing. Getting any number of significant digits on its future value is magical thinking.",

        "post_text": "TSLA plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.\n\nThis investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.\n\nWe don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's \"Investor Day,\" where he'll outline his \"Master Plan Part Three.\"  (source: [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-president-says-tesla-build-143052963.html))\n\nNot sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk? Here's a strategy so you don't have to be married to one direction. With this ratio spread you can make up to 14% (20% annualized) AND still be protected if TSLA dips. TSLA can fall to $125 (40% drop) before losing any capital.\n\nBuy 1 $205C, Buy 1 $220C, Sell 2 $230C, Sell 2 $125P All exp 11/17/23\n\nCapital required (minus premium) to cash secure trade: \\~$25K\n\nMax profit: $3556",

        "post_text": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review 12/24/22 As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company\u2019s business model\n\n\u00a7 Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.\n\no Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.\n\n\u00a7 They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.\n\n\u00b7 **Can it be Replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.\n\n\u00a7 Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)\n\n\u00a7 Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%\n\n\u00a7 ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%\n\n\u00a7 FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets\n\n\u00a7 Low-Cost Provider:\n\n\u00b7 Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \\~12% gross margins and \\~1% free cash flow margins.\n\n\u00b7 It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla\u2019s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.\n\n\u00a7 Intangibles\n\n\u00b7 As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon\u2019s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.\n\n\u00b7 Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.\n\n\u00b7 First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.\n\n\u00b7 Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don\u2019t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren\u2019t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.\n\n\u00b7 It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like \u201copen your butthole\u201d to access the charging port. It\u2019s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.\n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?\n\n\u00a7 Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.\n\n\u00a7 It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn\u2019t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.\n\n\u00a7 When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 Ha! Difficult, very difficult!\n\n\u00a7 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion\n\n\u00a7 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)\n\n\u00a7 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from \u201925 to \u201928)\n\n\u00a7 Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449\n\n\u00a7 Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \\~2.0%\n\n\u00a7 Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \\~5.4%\n\n\u00a7 Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.\n\n\u00a7 This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.\n\n\u00a7 Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.\n\n\u00a7 To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for \u201925.\n\n\u00a7 At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.\n\n\u00a7 With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.\n\n\u00a7 When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05\n\n\u00a7 With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA)\n\n10-Q 09/30/22: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022019867/tsla-20220930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022019867/tsla-20220930.htm)\n\n10-K 12/31/21: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm)\n\nCurrently Long TSLA\n\nEdit: Math Typos",

        "post_text": "$TSLA Bullish price is 287USD (DD) No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with an automotive sales part:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\\^9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\\^9 = **1.4T\\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 2. Automotive market.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)). Citation: \"... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ...\". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called \"New Energy vehicles\" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)). So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)), i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles)). Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e)): China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005505/en/Global-Automotive-Market-COVID-19-Growth-Forecast-2020-2030---ResearchAndMarkets.com)) global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com), we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:\n\n* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**\n* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**\n* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**\n* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nModel S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 4. ASP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)). It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf) (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Margins.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/shares-outstanding)), and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding)). Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings **total share dilution to 10.3%** (1.011\\^9).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn't play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The results:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:\n\n* our estimated target for market cap of **840B USD**, \n* and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, \n\nTesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\\^9 / (1.103) **= 323B USD today**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = **287 USD per share today**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Tesla bulls: before you say it's outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, **expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn't even account for.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter other product lines of Tesla:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/03/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-way-up-solar-slows-further/)). Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon's statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa's challenges and even before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). For the sake of the argument, let's say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\\*\\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That's where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that's where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it's one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Hype: To be continued...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter History.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz \"announced\" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....\n\nEdit: since many people are so kind to ask me to short Tesla, I just wanted to make clear I already shorted: [positions](https://imgur.com/a/EOz1rlC).

As much as we enjoy being school teachers it's not all bags of cash and rock star fame so doing our best to set up that nest (egg). All our milestones will interestingly happen in 5 year increments: kids to college, then my retirement, then hers.

        "post_text": "What would need to happen for TSLA to *not* be overvalued today? Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.\n\nIt's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.\n\n$880B \\* 1.10\\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share\n\nSo how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The \"for\" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:\n\n$1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings\n\nSo how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the \"TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold\" in the comments\n\nTesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about\n\n$57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually\n\nConclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&P. This isn't even including profits from the energy storage sector of the business, or the wildcards of robotaxis and bots.",

The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.\n\nThe Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.\n\nHe also said he expects Tesla to have \u201cunsupervised FSD\u201d up and running in Texas and California next year in the company\u2019s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla\u2019s premium driver assistance system, available today in a \u201csupervised\u201d version for Tesla electric vehicles.\n\nThe technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nIn reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk\u2019s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.\n\n\u201cAs expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla\u2019s growth endeavors in AI/AV \\[autonomous vehicles\\],\u201d Barclays\u2019 U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.\n\n\u201cYet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn\u2019t show its low-cost model planned for 1H\u203225 production,\u201d they added. \u201cWe also didn\u2019t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.\u201d\n\nPiper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that \u201cmost trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,\u201d the investment bank\u2019s analysts said in the note.\n\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank\u2019s analysts noted that Musk didn\u2019t mention any details on improvements to Tesla\u2019s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk\u2019s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.\n\nThe event \u201coverall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysts wrote in a note Friday.\n\n\u201cWe were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,\u201d they added.\n\nIt is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.\n\nAmong the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google\u2019s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",

Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).\r  \n\r  \nINTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.\r  \n\r  \nTSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).\r  \n\r  \nCan anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",

Interestingly, Musk sold $3.5 billion in tsla stock from 12-14.  \n\n**Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) investors are growing tired of Elon Musk's Twitter fiasco. And for good reason.\n\nThe 10 largest investors in the electric-vehicle maker's stock, including ETF giants Vanguard, **BlackRock** ([**BLK**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and [**Musk himself**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/elon-musk-sp500-lost-this-staggering-amount-on-tesla-stock/), lost nearly $133 billion since Twitter's board accepted Musk's buyout on April 25, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and [**MarketSmith**](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).\n\nIt cost Musk the position as the richest person in the world. But he's not alone feeling the pain.\n\n## Tesla Stock Dropping Like A Rock\n\nTesla's value is down more than 52% since the Twitter buyout was approved on April 25, while the S&P 500 is only off 5.5%. And Tesla stock is off 29% since the deal closed on Oct. 27, much worse than the S&P 500's 6.6% gain in that time. Shares are down again Wednesday, by 3.4% to 155.38.\n\nThat's shredding a jaw-dropping amount of wealth for Tesla investors. The value of Tesla is down $339 billion from the Twitter deal's approval and $206 billion from the close.\n\nInvestors worry that Musk is so infatuated with Twitter, he's not minding Tesla.\n\nInvestors owning shares of Tesla, now down more than 50% this year, are vocally expressing displeasure. \"There is no TSLA CEO today,\" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, which is down nearly $18 million on its Tesla stock since April, tweeted Monday, as [**first reported by the Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7).\n\n## It's Not Just Costing Elon Musk\n\nMusk is definitely [**suffering the most from the Tesla implosion**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-burned-as-musk-goes-ballistic-on-twitter/). As the largest shareholder with 14.1% of the company, he's personally lost $47.9 billion from the time the Twitter deal closed.\n\nBut losses are spreading to Main Street, too, as the giant ETF and mutual fund companies are the next biggest owners. Vanguard, which is [**forecasting a recession**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-vanguard-predicts-global-recession-next-year-why-to-believe/) next year, is the No. 2 largest holder of Tesla stock. It owns nearly 7% of the company. And due to that, its shareholders are down nearly $23 billion from the Twitter deal close.\n\nWhat will Musk's infatuation with Twitter ultimately cost Tesla investors?\n\n\"This remains the quagmire for Musk as well as Tesla investors in what has been a period of pain for Tesla bulls in a general risk-off backdrop with the Musk's golden child stock under major pressure,\" said Wedbush's Dan Ives in a note to clients.",

Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)\n\n-License approved to test FSD is China\n\n-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.\n\n-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th).

This will boost $ales.\n\n-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.\n\n-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)\n\n-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.\n\n-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.\n\n-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.\n\n-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.\n\nThe big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.\n\nTSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.\n\nI have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.\n\nLastly the debate is over, Telsa is a Tech company, its a conglomerate like GE once was.",

If Tesla\u2019s million-kilometer battery is really realized, electric vehicles will achieve a qualitative leap in mileage and battery life, and battery recycling will also become a thing of the past.\n\nSingle crystal cathode battery\n\nTesla single crystal cathode battery, this battery is also a lithium ion battery. It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.\n\nSilicon nanowire\n\nanode battery. The weight of the battery cell of this battery will be reduced by half, and the space occupied will be half of the current lithium ion battery. This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away. If this silicon nanowire anode battery is mass-produced and installed in a car, it may become a changer of current battery technology rules.\n\nTesla and the battery\n\nAs early as 2016, Tesla began funding the Tesla Canada Laboratory, which was composed of a team of scientists led by Jeff Dahn. Dann is a heavyweight in lithium-ion battery research. In more than 40 years, Dann has made many major breakthroughs in battery research. At the same time, in May 2019, Tesla spent US$218 million to acquire Maxwell, which specializes in the development of batteries and capacitors; in October 2019, Tesla acquired Hibar, the world\u2019s number one supercapacitor manufacturer in Canada; in February 2020, SilLion acquired SilLion Inc., a lithium-ion battery company. Today, Tesla has held a number of battery core patents by hiring battery technicians and buying companies.\n\nSummary\n\nTesla already has a number of new battery technologies. If the technology is mature enough, Tesla may no longer rely on Panasonic and Ningde\u2019s battery supply in the future. Tesla battery or will subvert the entire battery industry",

        "post_text": "A message to all the TSLA and NIO and general investors that are selling out and panicking. First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times I\u2019ve been called a \u201cboomer\u201d for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. \n\nIt\u2019s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. \n\n- Ask yourself what you\u2019ve learned about your risk tolerance. \n\n- Ask yourself what lessons you\u2019ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. \n\nWhen the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don\u2019t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y\u2019all. Y\u2019all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y\u2019all don\u2019t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. \n\nAbout a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai \n\nhttps://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/\n\nI think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y\u2019all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y\u2019all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn\u2019t normal. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to say \u201cbuy and hold forever!!!\u201d And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it\u2019s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. \n\nIt\u2019s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn\u2019t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can\u2019t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won\u2019t make money. \n\nPersonal way of dealing with this: \n\nWhen it comes to volatility, I\u2019ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It\u2019s hard but I\u2019ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I\u2019m buying and know why I am buying it. I\u2019ve done my DD over the companies I\u2019m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I\u2019ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I\u2019d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I\u2019m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I\u2019m being irrational and I need to buy the dip. \n\nSo these are just my observations. Not professional financial advice but the tips are what I personally do.",

Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv\n\nRevenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates\n\nNet income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAutomotive revenue, Tesla\u2019s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.\n\nTesla\u2019s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.\n\nThe company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.\n\nRevenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.\n\nTesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.\n\n\nShareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management\u2019s consideration were seeking updates on the company\u2019s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company\u2019s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.\n\nIn early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.\n\nA month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day\u2019s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.\n\nAccording to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.\n\nTesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/tesla-tsla-earnings-q1-2023.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard",

They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.\n\nWell, let's look at the data shall we...\n\nHere are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:\n\nVGT: +32.99% (Technology)  \nXLF: +34.87% (Financial)  \nXLE: +47.15% (Energy)  \nXLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  \nXLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  \nDBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  \nPAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  \nAVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  \nSCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  \nSMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  \nITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  \nTRVL: +6.82% (Travel)\n\nAs can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.\n\nSo can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.\n\nWishing everyone a successful 2022!",

Tesla is betting on Robotaxi this year.\n\nInstead of launching in the United States (subject to numerous regulatory approvals across various states), probably Tesla is pushing for a soft launch in Mainland China ...\n\nBullish or bearish?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSubsequent to the initial post, Reuters published an article indicating that US prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles\u2019 self-driving capabilities. Seems like Robotaxi by Tesla is still very remote for the US market ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**US seeks answers from Tesla in Autopilot recall probe**\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker's December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards.*\n\n*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla's recall. The agency's letter said it had identified \"several concerns\", regarding the recall.*\n\n*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*\n\n*The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y, X, S, 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years.*\n\n*Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self-driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel.*\n\n*NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter, which was made public on Tuesday, seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1.*\n\n*NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued.*\n\n*The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla's five-part recall remedy.*\n\n*One issue under investigation is Tesla's recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single-pull or double-pull of the drive stalk.*\n\n*NHTSA's letter said the single-pull activation of Autopilot \"is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field\" and testing \"showed it was possible to make this change while driving.\"*\n\n*Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall.*\n\n*NHTSA said it \"will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates, their impacts on subject vehicle field performance, and Tesla\u2019s basis for not including them\".*\n\n*Last month, NHTSA said it found evidence that \"Tesla\u2019s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot\u2019s permissive operating capabilities\" and that this results in a \"critical safety gap.\"*\n\n*NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which \"foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.\"*\n\n*NHTSA noted Tesla's December recall \"allows a driver to readily reverse\" the software update.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit, state media report says**\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-may-support-teslas-domestic-testing-demonstration-robotaxis-says-media-2024-05-08](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-may-support-teslas-domestic-testing-demonstration-robotaxis-says-media-2024-05-08)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis, during his recent visit to the country, the state-backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.*\n\n*Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China \"welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country\" and hopes it can \"set a good example\", the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.*\n\n*However, Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self-Driving (FSD) functions, the newspaper added.*\n\n*Before the full rollout of its FSD functions, Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla's cars need to train its driver-assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn't discussed in detail during Musk's visit.*\n\n*A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai, where the company's largest factory globally is located.*\n\n*Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*\n\n*The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month, where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang.*\n\n*Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles, Reuters previously reported.*\n\n*FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self-parking, auto lane changes and traffic navigation.*\n\n*Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla.*\n\n*Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China.*\n\n*The China Daily newspaper, however, citing a source close to Baidu, said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu's maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD.*\n\n*Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*\n\n*Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus.*\n\n*Last month, the company mentioned a \"purpose-built robotaxi product\" that it planned to build with a \"revolutionary\" manufacturing process, without offering a timeline for its release.*\n\n*China has been at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars, and companies such as Baidu and Toyota-backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Tesla Autopilot probe, US prosecutors focus on securities, wire fraud**\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles\u2019 self-driving capabilities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.*\n\n*Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes - but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.*\n\n*U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.*\n\n*Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.*\n\n*Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.*\n\n*The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla\u2019s representations about driver-assistance systems to investors, one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment.*\n\n*Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.*\n\n*The Justice Department declined to comment.*\n\n*The probe, which is not evidence of wrongdoing, could result in criminal charges, civil sanctions, or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed, one of the sources said, in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas.*\n\n*Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance technology for nearly a decade.*\n\n*Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say: \u201cThe person in the driver\u2019s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.\u201d*\n\n*A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos, posted in October 2016, intended to show the technology\u2019s potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media, writing: \u201cTesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway streets, then finds a parking spot.\u201d*\n\n*In a conference call with reporters in 2016, Musk described Autopilot as \u201cprobably better\u201d than a human driver. During an October 2022 call, Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel \u201cto your work, your friend\u2019s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.\u201d*\n\n*Musk is increasingly focused on self-driving technology as Tesla's car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long-awaited $25,000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth.*\n\n*\u201cGoing balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move,\u201d the billionaire executive posted on his social-media platform X in mid-April. Tesla shares, down more than 28% so far this year, surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there.*\n\n*Musk has repeatedly promised self-driving Teslas for about a decade. \"Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,\" Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing.*\n\n*LEGAL CHALLENGES*\n\n*Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla\u2019s autonomous-car claims are proceeding with caution, recognizing the legal hurdles they face, the people familiar with the inquiry said.*\n\n*They will need to demonstrate that Tesla\u2019s claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors, three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters.*\n\n*U.S. courts previously have ruled that \u201cpuffery\u201d or \u201ccorporate optimism\u201d regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008, a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors.*\n\n*Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge, Richman said, but the safety risk involved in overselling self-driving systems also \u201cspeaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors, a judge and jury would take the statements.\u201d*\n\n*FATAL CRASHES*\n\n*Tesla\u2019s claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits.*\n\n*Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology - including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving - have imbued customers with a false sense of security.*\n\n*In April, the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone, police records show. In a probable-cause statement, a trooper cited the driver\u2019s \u201cadmitted inattention to driving, while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him.\u201d*\n\n*In Washington state, a driver remains \"responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle\" regardless of its technological capabilities, a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters.*\n\n*The same month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot.*\n\n*NHTSA declined to comment.*\n\n*The recall followed a long-running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first-responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries.*\n\n*Tesla disputed NHTSA's findings but agreed to the recall, which employed over-the-air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers.*\n\n*The NHTSA investigation found \u201ca critical safety gap between drivers\u2019 expectations\u201d of Tesla\u2019s technology \u201cand the system\u2019s true capabilities,\u201d according to agency records. \u201cThis gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.\u201d*",

        "post_text": "All those TSLA FOMO's out there, it may be the time to get in Every week for the past 8 weeks, I've seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\n\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\n\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $2500 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $2500.\n\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.\n\nIf you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.\n\nEdit: some of my pre-post split math was wrong. Corrected here.",

        "post_text": "Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis ***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***\n\n# Introduction:\n\nTSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.\n\n# Market:\n\nTSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.\n\nIn Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   \n\n|Model|Price|Range|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|\n|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|\n|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|\n|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|\n\nIn Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. \n\n[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand. \r  \n\r  \nUltimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As \"people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It\u2019s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it\u2019s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference\r\n\n# Revenue:\n\nTSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely \u201cAutomotive Sales\u201d, \u201cServices and Others\u201d, \u201cAutomotive Lease\u201d, \u201cAutomotive Regulatory Credit\u201d and \u201cEnergy Generation and Storage sales\u201d. \n\n***Automotive Sales***\n\nAutomotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA\u2019s vehicles fully paid upfront.\n\nElon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. \u201cperhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology\u201d -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. \r\n\nWhen forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. \u201cthe sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.\u201d -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference.\r So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA\u2019s manufacturing technology was successful.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nWhen forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn\u2019t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.\r  \n\n\n***Services and Others***\n\nTSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA\u2019s network of SuperChargers.\r  \n\r  \nLifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))\n\nAssuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \\~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.\r\n\nWhen forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing\u2019s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. \n\n\r  \n***Automotive Lease***\n\nTSLA has 2 types of lease, \u201cDirect Vehicle Operations Lease\u201d which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. \u201cDirect Sales Lease\u201d either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA\u2019s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.\n\n\r  \n***Automotive Regulatory Credit***\n\nTSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.\n\n\u201cIt will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).\r  \n\r\n\nWhen forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. \n\n\r  \n***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***\n\nTSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.\r  \n\r  \nFor energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that \u201cThe most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).\r  \n\r  \nThe closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA\u2019s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.\r  \n\r  \nRight now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA\u2019s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing. \r  \nAs a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n# Cost:\n\n\r\u201cpredicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. \n\n  \nWhen forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I\u2019ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  \nWhen forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\n# WACC:\n\nUS 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%\r  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41\r  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%\r  \nCOE = 15.21%\r  \n \r  \nTSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))\r  \nCOD (1M Avg) = 5.72%\r  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%\r  \nAT-COD = 4.52%\r  \n\r  \nMarket Price (5D Avg) = $178.50\r  \nShares O/S = 3184.79M\r  \nMarket Value of Equity = 568485.02M\r  \n\r  \nWeighted Average Maturity = 2 Years\r  \nFY23 Interest Expense = 156M\r  \nMarket Value of Debt = 4578.78M\r  \n%Debt = 0.80%\r  \n%Equity = 99.20%\r  \nWACC = 15.12%\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA\u2019s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.\n\n\r\n\n|Name|Beta|\n|:-|:-|\n|Google (GOOG)|1.04|\n|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|\n|Meta (META)|1.21|\n\nTaking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.\r  \n\r  \nStable State COE = 8.95%\r  \nStable State AT-COD = 4.52%\r  \n\rTSLA\u2019s stable stage WACC = 8.90%\r  \n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business. \n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/nZjoZRs)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/aMYlmm3)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/2VOKzoU)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/rVQr2uF)\\]  \nRevenue Model (AUTOMOTIVE): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/ucXnT5K)\\]  \nRevenue Model (ENERGY STORAGE): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/xiRJYhN)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/KVByje0)\\]  \nChange in NWC: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/3rDs1Be)\\]",

        "post_text": "I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best. I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven\u2019t counted it up, but it\u2019s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades & Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

Here are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810\nTotal production Q1 2024: 433,371\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.\n\nIn the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company\u2019s shareholder communications.\n\nAccording to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.\n\nIndependent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.\n\nTesla\u2019s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts\u2019 estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.\n\nTesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.\n\nHouthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla\u2019s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.\n\nIn China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers\u2019 schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.\n\nIn the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla\u2019s newest model \u2014 an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck \u2014 which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.\n\nA series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.\n\nDuring the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company\u2019s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn\u2019t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nShares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company\u2019s IPO in 2010.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.\n\nTroy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories \u2014 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles \u2014 but doesn\u2019t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.\n\nTesla\u2019s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.\n\nIn April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, \u201cprimarily due to lower average selling price.\u201d\n\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla\u2019s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\nBut the sales drop also correlated with Tesla\u2019s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and \u201cpolitical rants.\u201d\n\nTesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.\n\nTesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.\n\nIn China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.\n\nColin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees \u201cdeclining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.\u201d He recommends selling Tesla shares.\n\nWells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the \u201clikelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes\u201d as the year continues.\n\nInvestor focus will now shift to Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or \u201cCyberCab.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/tesla-tsla-q2-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

        "post_text": "TSLA - Bull Case (Qualitative Opinion) A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. \n\n1.\tI sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. \n\n2.\tTesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn\u2019t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)\n\n3.\tTesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!\n\n4.\tThey are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something \u201cfrivolous\u201d like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. \n\n5.\tTesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. \n\n6.\tTesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes \u201cfat\u201d (ask any body builder). The \u201crecession\u201d is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!\n\n7.\tTesla is more than a car company\u201d. This is a polarizing statement! But let\u2019s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do. \n\n8.\tThey are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple\u2019s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!\n\n9.\tImportant point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!\n\n10. Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I\u2019m confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness. \n\n11. I\u2019m not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar & rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla. \n\nAgain, these are all the musings of a random fool that is me. I have an investment in Tesla and am adding to my position slowly but surely. The thesis behind my investment has not changed and there is nothing yet that gives me worry (yet).",

Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.\n\n[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/)\u00a0stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.\n\nEarlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of\u00a0Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.\n\nMusk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.\n\n \n\nAmong other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.\n\nMusk\u2019s Twitter distraction has shaken some of\u00a0Tesla\u2019s most stalwart bulls. For example, [CNBC Pro reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/wedbush-removes-tesla-from-its-top-stocks-list-says-twitter-deal-an-albatross.html), Wedbush Securities has removed\u00a0Tesla\u00a0from its top stock list.

When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla\u2019s parking lot, he said.\n\n\u201cThe intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,\u201d Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.\n\nWhen Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, \u201cTesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.\u201d\n\nTesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla\u2019s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, \"It does not.\"\n\nElluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. \"\n\n\nWhat do you guys make of all this? Is everyone still permabullsih on Tesla or are the tides turning against them? Of course Elon is no longer chairman so doesnt have as much control as previously, however he does still have significant control of the company and bad PR for him often means bad PR for Tesla. The two are almost inextricably linked given his holdings.\n\nPersonally I don't want to touch anything this man is involved with and haven't done so for a good year now, and that seems to be working pretty well. Kudos to anyone who's been making bank swing trading Tesla though and good luck to those who believe in the company long term. I wish I could, but I just don't trust them.",

Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.\r  \n\r  \nThe company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.\r  \n\r  \nApple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn\u2019t last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year\u2019s end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.\r  \n\r  \nAnd while Apple stock saw the company\u2019s valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn\u2019t closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.\r  \n\r  \nDespite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latter iPhone is expected to be the first with a periscope-design lens system for enhanced optical zoom.\r  \n\r  \nApple Vision Pro, the company\u2019s all-new AR/VR product, will hit stores in the United States in early 2024. The product carries a $3,499 price tag. Corrective lenses are sold separately.",

Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.\n\nMETA & MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.\n\nOverall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait & see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers & what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.\n\nFYI I own AAPL stock",

They\u2019re climbing in the United States. And so there\u2019s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there\u2026 we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an environment to guide into,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Josh Lipton. \n\nApple hasn\u2019t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nHowever, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that \u201cinitial data points are really quite good.\u201d\n\niPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple\u2019s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren\u2019t counted in this quarter.\n\nRevenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. \n\nSales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.\n\n\u201cA larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that\u2019s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll grow in Q1,\u201d Cook told CNBC.\n\nApple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. \n\nInvestors are always closely examining Apple\u2019s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. \n\nOn Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",

The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.\n\n**Quick Stats**\n\n* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)\n* **Market Cap:** $3,019B\n* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62\n* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)\n\n**What's Driving the Turnaround?**\n\nApple\u2019s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here\u2019s the kicker: Apple\u2019s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple\u2019s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.\n\n**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**\n\nApple\u2019s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.\n\n**Should You Buy In?**\n\nAnalysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple\u2019s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250\u2014a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.\n\nHere\u2019s the play: Apple\u2019s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100\u2019s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you\u2019re looking for a solid entry.\n2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.\n3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.\n\n",

        "post_text": "Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10%  Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. \n\nApple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company\u2019s history, and a 22% increase over last year\u2019s $90 billion authorization.  \n\nHere\u2019s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: \n\nEPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated \n\nRevenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated \n\niPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated \n\nOther Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated \n\nApple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that overall sales would \u201cgrow low single digits\u201d during the June quarter.  \n\nApple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  \n\nApple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. \n\nCook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. \n\n\u201cIf you remove that $5 billion from last year\u2019s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.\u201d \n\nApple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year\u2019s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  \n\nMac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment\u2019s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company\u2019s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  \n\nOther Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. \n\nDuring the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple\u2019s major product lines.  \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only scratching the surface there so we couldn\u2019t be more excited about our opportunity there,\u201d Cook said. \n\nApple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  \n\nCook also said Apple has \u201cbig plans to announce\u201d from an \u201cAI point of view\u201d during its iPad event next week as well as at the company\u2019s annual developer conference in June.  \n\nServices was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That\u2019s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple\u2019s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  \n\nSales in Greater China, Apple\u2019s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  \n\n\u201cI feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,\u201d Cook said. \n\nCook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. \u201cThat may come as a surprise to some people,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nIn addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple\u2019s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple\u2019s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.  \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2024.html",

I am a big tech guy and I have been following Apple for a while. Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.\n\nToday, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.\n\nEDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \\*historically\\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump all of the money I have rather than DCAing. Also, very stupid of me to say that Apple owns TSM. But the reason why I don't think it's smart to invest into TSM is because the chip designs are still done by Apple, meaning that Apple is still in control for how well the chips manufactured by TSM and how they perform with  ARM and MacOS software. Hardware performance is dependent on software integration -- the very reason why investing into Apple is more reliable than TSM (though yes both are viable options).",

        "post_text": "Is AAPL a good buy right now? Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Apple\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple\u00b4s stock of **$99 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple\u00b4s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$94 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith Apple\u00b4s price being at **$160** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s a little too high. That\u00b4s why I don\u00b4t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see Apple\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$293 per share** which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That\u00b4s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.\n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don\u00b4t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don\u00b4t double in 5 years, I\u00b4m rather bullish on this company.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.\n\nA lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.\n\nGiven economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again? Have the fundamentals of the business improved so much that it offsets the heightened economic risks? I genuinely don't understand what's so attractive about this stock.",

(AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.\n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.\n\nPreviously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.\n\nThe move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.\n\nApple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.\n\nThe company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.\n\nThe company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.\n\nThe new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).\n\nApple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.\n\nSo far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.\n\nApple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.\n\nIn each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.\n\nApple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.\"\n\nPersonally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",

Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.\n\nFirst up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.\n\nNext up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.\n\nLastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.\n\nLooking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.\n\n  \nedit, fixed percentage ups ytd.",

They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.\n\nWell, let's look at the data shall we...\n\nHere are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:\n\nVGT: +32.99% (Technology)  \nXLF: +34.87% (Financial)  \nXLE: +47.15% (Energy)  \nXLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  \nXLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  \nDBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  \nPAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  \nAVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  \nSCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  \nSMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  \nITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  \nTRVL: +6.82% (Travel)\n\nAs can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.\n\nSo can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.\n\nWishing everyone a successful 2022!",

        "post_text": "QCOM Vs. AAPL settlement. How I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 on a very stupid decision Hello Everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just needed a place to vent, because I just made the most stupid decision in my life, and I can't really justify it to myself or anyone that I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in February, I decided that QCOMs case vs AAPL was putting a lot of pressure on the QCOMs stock price and realized that the options are very cheap considering the opportunity for a favorable outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought 75 April 18 call options with a strike price of 65 for $0.10 each, and till yesterday night I was still holding them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in Australia, so I am mostly sleeping during US trading hours. Yesterday, however, I woke up at 4 am and decided to put a limit sell order of $0.06 on my options to salvage my losses given that only 2 days are remaining till expiry, and went back to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wake up at 7 am to go to work, and see the news and realize that my options would have been worth a small fortune and the contract is being traded at $6 each which would have realized a 6000% return for me in 2 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 just because I made a very stupid decision when I woke up at 4 AM! I feel so disgusted with myself and I dont know what to do to feel better. I got everything right but screwed up at the last minute. I feel so angry with myself and having a mental breakdown, and I needed to let someone know what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I live myself and go on with my life after that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of those who offered support and understanding of the situation. I truly understand my mistake, and I know I failed because I never really had a risk and an action plan. It was never about trading for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started following QCOM back in 2016 and I knew almost everything about the lawsuits and the risks facing the company. In January and February, when the stock fell to the 50s, I started building my thesis and realized the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelecom Companies started tolling 5G networks.\n\nPhone manufacturers are introducing 5G phones in 2019.\n\nHuwaei and Qualcomm are the global leaders in 5G modems.\n\nIntel is far behind in 5G technology and the sole supplier for AAPL modems.\n\nAAPL cannot really introduce a 5G phone in 2019 if they don't settle with Qualcomm early in the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven the above, I was almost certain that the settlement will happen, and when I looked into options I knew the risk/return were exceptional so I decided to take a small position. Unfortunately for me, I got the timing just wrong because I haven't planned on rerolling my options and I took action at a time when I wasn't really aware of the complete consequences of selling my position. When I think about it now, I know how stupid that was, just because the option was trading at 0.03 when I put my limit order, and the only reason my order will be executed at 0.06 will be favorable news. If I analyzed that more at the time, I would have realized that putting the order is the worst possible decision. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA hard lesson for sure..",

However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here \n\nI'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.\nDoing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...\n\nThat's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:\nBuy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.\n\nBut I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.\nFast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?\nI don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. \nMaybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.\nI have no idea.\nBut I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.\nFeel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).\nCheers.\n",

Its in my ROTH so no taxes and I'm up 68% right now from a little over a year I think or maybe 1.5 years.\n\nAnyways how much upside is really left in AAPL short term? Maybe $200 if we're REALLY lucky.  And then it won't stay there all year!\n\nSo I've decided to sell all my shares and buy them back after we correct another 25 to 50% after fed hits the brakes on balance sheet.\n\nSomeone said once FED starts reducing balance sheet we're gonna fall maybe 25 to 50%.  Some people are saying the sp500 will go down maybe 90% ..... Dan Niles I think said it.\n\nToday Dan said that we should be 100% cash. I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.\n\nAnyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!\n\nHow's my plan? Monday hopefully I can start selling AAPL.\n\nThanks all and may the force be with you.",

The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.\n\nApple\u2019s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.\n\nApple\u2019s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.\n\nApple\u2019s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.\n\nAnd Nikkei Asia reports that Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.\n\nStay ahead of the market\nBut Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel\u2019s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.\n\nAnd then there are reports about Apple\u2019s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.\n\nApple\u2019s rise to $3 trillion hasn\u2019t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it \u201ccomplies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.\u201d\n\nLike its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, \u201cFortnite\u201d maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.\n\nWhile the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.\n\nThe company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple\u2019s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.\u201d",

        "post_text": "MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI.  I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

        "post_text": "There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks. An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?\n\nThe answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]\n\nThis post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.\n\n**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**\n\n[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)\n\nFrom another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):\n\n> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000\u00ae Index) led both large caps (S&P 500\u00ae) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap\u00ae) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.\n\n\nBut even outside of recessions, the outperformance is [robust across many decades](https://i.imgur.com/W0sAt4K.png), though. [Another graph](https://i.imgur.com/0OaFiH1.png),  and [another](https://i.imgur.com/HBkJ6aA.png).\n\n**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**\n\n Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)\n\nThis has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [\"Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk\"](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]\n\nThus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.\n\n**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**\n\n- US small cap value is relatively insulated from the broader global economy, unlike the enormous multinational firms dominating the S&P 500. They do not face the currency risks that are currently hitting large cap company's revenues. [Source](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/insights/article/why-small-cap-value-now.do) and [source](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/small-cap-interview).\n- Right now, the problem in the US economy is its strong labor market. Small cap value stocks see more earnings growth (relative to large firms) in such periods. \n- [Expected earnings for small caps](https://i.imgur.com/yJ1DPGZ.png) from [this source](https://www.lordabbett.com/en-us/financial-advisor/insights/markets-and-economy/a-strengthening-case-for-small-cap-stocks.html).\n- [Returns to expect](https://i.imgur.com/4sc85CZ.png) given these valuations in small caps. (Same link)\n- \"In 2022 small caps suffered their worst first-half drawdown since the inception of the Russell 2000\u00ae Index in 1978, falling 23.4%.\" [Source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/).\n- They are at historically cheap levels: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/L2gY3Xl.png). In this table, we see the ratio of valuations of large cap to small cap stocks. [Higher = small cap is cheaper]. [Source](https://www.aaii.com/investor-update/article/15037-small-cap-stocks-are-cheap-relative-to-large-cap-stocks).\n- [Here is a measure](https://i.imgur.com/XGLxpPG.png) of the cheapness of value stocks (large or small) compared to growth.

I'll include a few of those quotes:\n\n> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.\n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/e3fb3c34-b982-4827-9762-f5b9a8d33dc5)\n\n> \n> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks \u2014 Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks \u2014 the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.\n\n[Source](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/)\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst:\n\n>  Meanwhile, small cap stocks trade at much more attractive valuation levels than large-caps, according to the note. The S&P SmallCap 600 trades at a P/E multiple of 11x, which is near its cheapest level of the last 30 years. \"This multiple also represents a 30% discount to the S&P 500,\" Kostin said.  That's the largest discount since the dot-com bubble, and if earnings don't deteriorate meaningfully from here, it could represent a big opportunity for investors.\n\n[Source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-valuations-rich-small-caps-value-interest-rates-2022-10)\n\n**Cheapness is even more pronounced in Europe**\n\n\n> Arnold also writes \u201cvalue stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they\u2019ve actually de-rated over the last five years.\u201d\n\n> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: \u201cThe Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!\u201d\n> \n> Finally, Arnold writes that \u201cover the last five years Europe\u2019s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!\u201d \n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) \n\nAnother [valuation graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png) for Europe valuations\n\n**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**\n\n>  After Japan's bubble burst, from 1990 to 2019, Japanese total country returns averaged 0.6%. Japanese small cap value averaged 5.13% and Japanese value stocks averaged 4%. During 2000-2010,  US small cap value grew 7.94% on average and US value stocks grew 4.56% on average, in contrast to a declining/flat S&P 500. \n\n\nSource: Ben Felix's various videos on small cap value.\n\nYou aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.\n\n**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**\n\nBecause market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?\n\n**Ticker recommendations**:\n\nI use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.\n\nI explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. \n\n> They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies \"tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning\ntheir prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent\nunderperformance.\" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.\n\n> [You can read about their approach to investing here](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/dam/ac/pdfs/ipro/viewpoint/iuo/scientific-approach-to-investing.pdf).",

        "post_text": "Bad Apple: Why AAPL is Heavily Overvalued Let me first start by saying AAPL is a tremendous company with an incredibly strong present and future - contrary to the title. They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.\n\nRight now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.\n\nLet's observe the last 4 years of revenue:\n\n* 2018 = $266B\n* 2019 = $260B\n* 2020 = $275B\n* **2021 = $366B**\n\nOne of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.\n\nI'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**.\n\n**RUSH**\n\nWhen a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.\n\n**CRUSH**\n\nThe next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**\n\n**HUSH**\n\n2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.\n\nIn the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).\n\nEssentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.\n\nI read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!\n\nWould love to see your thoughts below. I'm sure this will be controversial and I look forward to hearing the opposite side of this argument to see what I might be overlooking.",

Here\u2019s a long term perspective to consider.\n\nAAPL is now down 30%, but a return to all time high means a 183/129 = 42% return. If you\u2019re happy with an average annual return of 10%, then buying now means AAPL has 4 years to get back to ATH in order for it to be a good investment for you. \n\nObviously a faster return to ATH gives an even better average return. (I oversimplify the math a little by ignoring compounding)\n\nA similar analysis on these blue chips shows that a return to ATH in,\n\n- MSFT: 4.5 years\n\n- GOOG: 5 years\n\n- AMZN: 8 years\n\nWould equate to an average annual return of ~10%. \n\nIf your time horizon is more than a few years, these are great times to be in the market.\n\n\nEDIT: Most people seem to think I'm legitimately asking the question in the title. I'm not, this is a way to mentally reframe the market outlook without any real analysis (just simple math). Enjoy the stock sale.",

He doesn't believe there's a \"supercycle\" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the \"stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem.\"\n\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/31/ubs-upgrades-aapl-to-buy-raises-price-target-on-iphone-stability-auto-opportunity",

        "post_text": "I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned. Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.\n\nI had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.\n\nTo celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\n**I can't predict the stock market.**\n\n*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.\n\nYou can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)",

        "post_text": "For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing. #DON'T PANIC\n\n(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)\n\nFor what it is worth this is my advise:\n\nSAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. \n\n#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. \n\n\n::\n# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. \n\n::\n\nI was really just talking about pocket change \n\nTry to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. \n\nIf you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.\n\nThis is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. \n\nYou either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. \n\nMy grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. \n\nGo to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. \n\nNone of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  \n\nIn 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. \n\nDon't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?\n\nBroad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. \n\nI like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. \n\nPick a solid broker, read above. \n\n#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. \n\nDon't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)\n\nStart with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.\n\nAfter you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. \n\nMaybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. \n\nAfter you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  \n\nDon't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. \nIf you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. \n\nIf you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. \n\nLook at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.\n\nDon't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. \n\n#DONT PANIC. \n\nDon't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.\n\nLearn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.\n\nBuy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).\n\n\nLearn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. \n\nTime in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the day... just do something. \n\nDo not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. \n\nTry not to fall into investment fads.\n\nWhen I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.\n\nAnd buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.\n\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*\n\n**last edit: swords for plowshares boys**\n\nPS: I upvoted you all so far, love this late(early) discussion. Going to sleep now. Whether you agree with me or not, I wish you all solid gains. It is not about you or them, or your gains vs his/her loss. I hope you all make gains and that my small insite can lead future generations(or my own or past) to an easy life where we maybe don't have yachts or pent houses, but at the same time.... have to die young of stress and ill health, and can just have the money to be content and happy and be like me,... spending this week digging a new garden, and not be broken old men/women like I see so often.\n\nAnd if you dont like that, if you say everyone should \"pull up them boot straps\" then I say Fuk you. That didn't work. So I won, and I hope I can teach even one kid to win to\n\n#dont award this, take that and buy some stocks or donate to St Jude or something, I dont even know what those things are but I know it cost $$. This whole sub is about saving and investing, investing in lame awards for my dumb ass isnt working. Charity IS A WRITE OFF. \n\nAnd dont PM me please, I'm not a D but I do not know how to reply. Reddit changed and I did not change with it.\n\n# EDIT DOWN---->\n\n# edit** Thanks for all those awards: I think I said something about NOT throwing money down?! That's what you did. I also said not to do that.\n\n#Please, don't buy single ply toilet paper, but don't give me awards either. \n\nI have seen some comments about the whole  15% comment I made below. It is TOTALLY about what I said above about knowing financial products, and managing things yourself in your brokerage. \n\nI DO NOT SELF MANAGE MY IRAs.  MY IRAs truck  along just fine. \n\nBut I do manage my margin account. I use every thing I can to make more $$. And options are a big part. I am not making insane call buys. I sell covered calls and buy cash secured puts. I sell iron condors or butterflies (depends on the equity). I follow trends and waves and rotations and I use leaps and verticals. \n\n(This is me, I am not an advisor, I'm an idiot on the internet.. DO NOT DO WHAT I DO, THIS IS ONLY ME AND ME ALONE. I AM ONLY TELLING THE PUBLIC WHAT I HAVE DONE AS A SOLITARY INVESTOR.) \n\nBUT: I closed almost every position I had 2 weeks ago. I got greedy enough last year and till now, I had a great return. I'm stepping back.",

        "post_text": "What is a True Market Leader (TML) + And how to find them? (Ex. SHOP 2016-2020, ZM 2020, AAPL 2005-2012 **TLDR:**\n\nIn one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.\n\nTMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share  O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books\n\n* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil\n*  Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik\n* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail \n\n**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities\n\nApple 2003  [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)\n\nNetflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)\n\nHome Depot 1982 [https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU](https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU)\n\nQualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)\n\nYahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)\n\n**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**\n\n* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY\n* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY\n* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters\n* ROE >17%\n* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%\n\nAnd above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.\n\nTMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)\n\nAdditionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.\n\n**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**\n\nThey should be:\n\n* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average\n* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base\n* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)\n* Volume and Price contractions within bases\n* Up/Down Vol> 1.2\n* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat\n* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.\n\nDuring corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling \"Buy me\".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.\n\n**So how to scan for them:**\n\nUse MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.\n\nHere is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)\n\n**Recent examples to study**\n\n$LVGO 2020  \n$TSLA 2019-2020  \n$DOCU 2019-2020  \n$PTON 2020  \n$SHOP 2016-2020  \n$AMD 2018  \n$ZM 2020",

It should be noted that TSLA now has a market cap higher than the combination of Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda all combined. It should also be noted that Toyota alone sells nearly 10 million cars and Tesla 500k\u2026..\n\nThis post is not about that though\u2026however Cathie Wood says that TSLA should be worth 3,000 easy, in her base case. \\[Mind you she just dumped\u2026 along with insiders that sell every day of the week check form 4\\] Whatever is the case if TSLA is 3,000 a share it will rival the largest company in the world AAPL.

For years it was one of the few Big Tech companies to avoid major antitrust action by the US. Now it is under intense scrutiny from regulators in two of its key markets, the US and the EU. Its responses have indicated it is steeling itself for an existential battle.  \n\n\nApple said the US case \u201cthreatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets\u201d. A loss would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d by allowing the government to influence how technology markets developed, it added.  \n\n\nThe new US lawsuit is broad and detailed, painting a picture of a company that has spent years knowingly heading off competitive threats to its ecosystem, be it on the App Store, in messaging with rival Android phones, on its \u201ctap to pay\u201d service, or in the smartwatch market.  \n\n\nArticle without the paywall here: [https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.ft.com/content/b1c7913f-cec2-47ea-9566-f65953c875fe](https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.ft.com/content/b1c7913f-cec2-47ea-9566-f65953c875fe)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post_text": "6 reasons why AAPL isn't a pandemic stock **tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.\n\nAAPL is still up \\~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?\n\nHere are my 6 reasons:\n\n* **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.\n* **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic\n* **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.\n* **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic**, which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.\n* **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.\n* **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying \"Apple products are overpriced\" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...",

        "post_text": "Apple today is a good example why the markets are so hard. Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, \"Why did the markets go up/down today?\"\n\nAnd there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, \"Because there were more buyers than sellers\" (or vice versa).\n\nApple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.\n\nHowever, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.\n\nSome folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.\n\nWith all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and \"fly\" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.\n\nFull disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.\n\nThere is currently a bubble in \"safe\" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a \"flight to safety\" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.\n\nI think the moves in these \"value\" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. \"You won't be fired for buying IBM\". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP? You'll still have your job.",

        "post_text": "Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy? Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Apple\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow. \n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. \n\nFor the valuation: \n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple\u00b4s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple\u00b4s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that. \n\nBecause Apple\u00b4s price is higher right now, I don\u00b4t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\nWhere I see Apple\u00b4s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. \n\nWhat I\u00b4ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don\u00b4t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. \n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

I'm only a beginner so bare with me I would just like some help with understand the growth of these stocks before I commit to investing\n\n\nGoogle - it's one of the most successful companies in the world each year their revenue increases significantly. However they are trading at high valuation which means the market is expecting high growth which might be true but is this likely? If they already have a monopoly in this sector (outside China) where will the additional growth come from? Ad revenue is the main one but as entrenched as they are it feels like therr are vulnerable points like changes in regulation or technology which makes advertising less valuable etc etc.From my limited understanding they are invested in other sectors too such as AI so what is the expected growth in this sector and what percentage would google take? \n\n\n\nApple - Smartphone giants, smartphones seem like they will always be a huge part of society. Also apple are looking into other sectors such as TV or electric cars. However if smart phone are only increasing 2% that would mean if Apple were to grow beyond 2% per year they would need to take market share from their competitors\n\n\n\nAMD - Not sure if the valuation is high or not. I believe they are in a duopoly with nvidea and they have around 15% of the sector. I think their valuation may be high so again I'm guessing people on here expect the chip market to grow substantially while mainting their market share? How realistic is this and what differentiates them from nvidea?",

I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp\\_at\\_33\\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\\_en-US\\_ttl\\_rf\\_recent\\_news\\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/\r  \n\r  \nAnalysis:\r  \n\r  \nAmazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:\r  \n\r  \nExpansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.\r  \n\r  \n\"Voluntary\" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:\n\n\\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.\r  \n\r  \nImplementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:\r  \n\r  \n\\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean\u2014to avoid excessive storage fees\u2014now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.\r  \n\r  \nThis policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of \"low inventory\" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the \"voluntary\" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Overall Financial Impact:\\*\\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.\r  \n\r  \nBonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.\r  \n\r  \nExtra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.\r  \n\r  \nPosition: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN.

Yahoo Finance Live examines the former CEO's timeline of past stock sales while he currently owns 988 million shares in the e-commerce retailer.\n\nJeff Bezos is reportedly looking to offload more of his stake in Amazon. The former CEO is looking to sell up to 10 million shares. This is according to a report out from CNBC, which comes after he already shelled up just about $240 million worth of the stock last week. Now, Bezos still owns 988 million Amazon shares.

Right? \n\nIt seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don\u2019t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up.

Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. \n\nAll and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I\u2019ve learned my lesson: **if you aren\u2019t willing to hold the underlying, don\u2019t buy it just solely for the merger.**",

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably won\u2019t do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.\n\nAmazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nThey are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. \n\nTheir PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades & Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

Stock Splits are a marketing maneuver, aimed at making a high-priced stocks more attractive to retail investors, who might consider buying it. Stock splits also make options contracts more affordable for retail investors.\n* My prediction is that Amazon will also be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apple, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, which brought it from over $600 a share, to less than $100 per share, and it joined the Dow in 2015.\n* Adding high-priced shares to the Dow is problematic because the index is price weighted, meaning the same percentage move matters more for a high priced stock than a low priced one.\n* This is Amazon's first stock split since 1999, and the fourth since Amazon\u2019s IPO in 1997. Amazon did a 2-for-1 split on June 2, 1998; a 3-for-1 split on Jan. 5, 1999; and a 2-for-1 split on Sept. 2, 1999.\n* Amazon shares are up over 4,300% since the last split was announced.\n* Google announced a 20-for-one split in February, Apple announced a 4-for-1 split in August 2020, Tesla announced a 5-to-1 split on August 2020 (Nvidia announced a 4-to-1 split in July 2021.)\n* AMZN will begin trading at its new split-adjusted price on Monday, June 6, 2022.",

        "post_text": "I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned. Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.\n\nI had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.\n\nTo celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\n**I can't predict the stock market.**\n\n*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.\n\nYou can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)",

In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems\n      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\\_logic\\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.\n      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\\_and\\_logical\\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).\n      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Robotic process automation**\n   * **Blue Prism - $PRSM - Need DD**\n   * **UiPath - $UIPTH (IPO later this year)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Semi-Conductors:**\n   * **ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML)** \\- From u/MikeJamesBurry the most important Europe Stock.

He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3\u2032s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.\n\nDeliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi\u2019s car factory, for which all \u201ckey\u201d steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.\n\nEarlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan \u201cunder 500,000 yuan\u201d ($69,328).\n\nThe car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.\n\nTesla\u2019s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.\n\nBYD\u2019s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.\n\nNio\u2019s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng\u2019s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr\u2019s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.\n\nSales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.\n\nAccessories\n\nThe heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.\n\nLei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.\n\nThe SU7 supports Apple\u2019s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.\n\nTesla\u2019s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d for city streets has yet to be released in the country.\n\nDespite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the \u201cMax\u201d version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche\u2019s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.\n\nEcosystem of devices\n\nThe SU7 is part of Xiaomi\u2019s recently launched \u201cHuman x Car x Home\u201d strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company\u2019s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.\n\nAlthough Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 \u2014 and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.\n\nLu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.\n\nThe company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle\u2019s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/xiaomi-releases-electric-car-4k-cheaper-than-teslas-model-3-as-price-wars-heat-up.html",

        "post_text": "A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this year Over the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&P 500 index this year. \n\nI am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) \n\nDespite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. \n\nMeanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. \n\nBut, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. \n\nThere are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&P. \n\nI have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. \n\nOne last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&P is not very ESG. Everybody \"buying the haystack\" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. \n\nIn summary, this is r/stocks. We should be encouraging informative and intellectual discussion about stocks, and not ridiculing fellow redditors like they're a bunch of idiots.",

        "post_text": "Does $HIMS have a chance against $AMZN ???  I am now convinced [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) is so undervalued due to [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click) launching Amazon Clinic last month nationwide in the US. I have done some research on the competitive landscape Hims is up against! \n\n1) Amazon Healthcare offers \u201cmultiple telehealth provider groups\u201d who each set their own rates for service. The company says those visits will cost an average of $75. And $35 for a messaging session. (No insurance is accepted). I went through the sign up process for this, and it was similar to making an Amazon purchase - simple and quick. It's definitely a large competitive threat. But the platform is cut and dry and doesn't offer the educational material or specialized treatments that [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) does. Additionally the brand may not \"feel\" trustworthy to some with their personal health information either, IMO. Amazon has work to do on their branding power in this space. Nonetheless, I have no doubt they will be a leader in the space.  \n\n2) Teledoc - works with all major insurance carriers. The website seems a decade or 2 old for the sign up process. [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&src=cashtag_click) is a \"stayer\" in the space for the foreseeable future due to being grandfathered in with the insurance companies and regulators. The management has taken some large missteps recently in overpaying in purchasing other companies. I dont see them as a long term threat to [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) because their innovation is lacking, and management does not seem like a bootstrapping company like [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click). Not to mention, their branding is B2B, so I get the impression they are not investing in their image/branding, which could hurt them later.  \n\n3) [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) has a major advantage in this space of being one of the only major founder led companies that is a fearless innovator. While being a company focused only on healthcare, dominating multiple segments in a short period, and starting to branch out into multiple segments. Further, the B2C branding, I believe, will help them win in the long run as they build trust with the public. I believe any telehealth company should invest in building this trust the same way your local hospital builds trust with their local community.  \n\nConclusion- [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click) is their largest competitive threat, IMO, but as [$NFLX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NFLX&src=cashtag_click) has been able to survive/thrive in the streaming space against Amazon, I don't see any reason Hims can't do the same. I believe Hims is an exciting shopping experience where you can get expert information and personalized products at a great price. A great thing about [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) as well is the no judgment experience, discreet packaging, and the trustworthy reputation they're building when dealing with HIPPA. [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click)'s threat is convenience, price, deep pockets, and efficiency. However, when it comes to health, I think people will want the personalized service. It is not the same as ordering dog food and toilet paper online. One downside I've seen as well is that Amazon is basing part of their clinic business on collecting your data. I believe there will be a decent percentage of people who will not trust \"big evil\" Amazon with their personal health data. It is difficult to do a really good competitive analysis because some of this is still speculation since [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) and [$amzn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24amzn&src=cashtag_click) are so new in the space. A lot of segments are yet to be penetrated, and neither are able to accept insurance yet. I believe these 2 will end up taking most of the space while [$tdoc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24tdoc&src=cashtag_click) gets left behind. ",

So, a bad earnings could be partially priced in with this decline. \n\nSecond, AMZN blew earnings last quarter (Q3 '21) when they had a 59.4% decline in Net Income forcing a small sell off back in Oct of last year.  Now, their expectations are 50% lower than they were in Q4 of '20 ($7 EPS vs. $3.67 EPS for this quarter) so much of their slower growth/high transport cost has been priced in. \n\nThird, their stock is already down nearly 26% from its November high, so the likelihood of another massive correction like we saw with FB/NFLX is unlikely since investors have already sold off.  While, there is always room to go down more, if AMZN offers any kind of positive guidance, I believe the stock will do very well! \n\ntl;dr\n\nWhile this is still a risky play since investors have not been kind to slowing growth of these companies, AMZN has done a lot of bleeding already, their EPS estimates are in the trash, and everyone is already fearful of whats to come.

        "post_text": "Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis ***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***\n\nBefore I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued. \n\n# Introduction:\n\nAMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\n***Established Logistics Network***\r  \nAMZN\u2019s most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports. \r  \n\r  \n***Strong Reverse Logistics***\r  \nConsumers increasingly perceive easy & free returns as essential ([SOURCE](https://www.powerreviews.com/research/reduce-returns/)). A very large C.A. for AMZN is its established reverse logistics as evidenced by AMZN being able to offer free return shipping for such a large volume of goods due to them expanding the scale of their reverse logistics that it makes economical sense for them to be able to offer these services for free. AMZN has also increased the ease of returning products, for example, by using UPS stores as a physical retail location where customers can drop off their parcels. UPS is reliant on AMZN as well, accounting for 11% of UPS revenue which gives AMZN large leverage over UPS ([SOURCE](https://www.wsj.com/business/fedex-amazon-discuss-returns-4325af30?st=oo1tomj716vco8d&reflink=article_copyURL_share))\r  \n\r  \nHow retailers manage their reverse logistics is also important as it is an additional outlet of significant revenue source. A few notable strides that AMZN is taking in this front is FBA Grade and Sell, where AMZN grades the item that buyers returned and grades it. Afterward, 3P Sellers (FBA Sellers) set the price based on the condition of the product. \r  \n\r  \n***Branding Goodwill***\r  \nEven though in recent years a few large e-commerce platforms have appeared such as Taobao, Shoppee, and Alibaba. AMZN has managed to maintain its reputation as a place that consumers will turn to if they want to get high-quality, safe, and reliable products that would not be flimsy or poorly made. The main reason why people use Taobao or Alibaba is because it is a website to get quasi items at a fraction of the price ([SOURCE](https://ec4ulimited.com/advantages-disadvantages-taobao-shopping/#:~:text=Goods%20from%20Taobao%20are%20cheap,for%20same%20or%20similar%20items)). Consumers have grown to accept the compromise in quality in exchange for a discount, this may be great in an economic downturn but during an average or booming macro environment, it ends up becoming a disadvantage. On top of that, by competing on price Taobao and Alibaba in the long run is unable to earn much margins and reinvest substantially to grow their business at a pace comparable to AMZN.\n\n# Revenue:\n\n\r***Retail Sales***  \nRetail sales refer to AMZN\u2019s online marketplace and physical stores.   \nAMZN has such large economies of scale that they can offer higher quality products for cheaper. \u201cAmazon prices are 13% cheaper than other retailers for essential items.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.grocerygazette.co.uk/2022/11/16/amazon-prices-cheaper-retailer/#:~:text=Amazon%20prices%2013%25%20cheaper%20than%20other%20retailers%20for%20essential%20items,-FMCGNewsSupermarkets&text=Amazon%20prices%20are%20an%20average,a%20new%20study%20has%20revealed)). On top of that, the increasing convenience of AMZN through speedier delivery increases the appeal of AMZN. \u201cmore than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever)).   \nAMZN can achieve higher rates of same-day delivery due to their strategy called \u201cregionalization\u201d, where they store items closer to customers. This results in customers choosing AMZN to deliver their everyday shopping needs as AMZN can get them their items significantly faster. Regionalization also allows AMZN to save on cost which in turn allows AMZN to offer a wider variety of items at a lower Average Selling Price (ASP) profitably. On top of that, AMZN has also released RUFUS an interactive AI model that allows the user to chat with it to get more personalized recommendations based on the consumer's diverse requirements.\n\n  \nAMZN's next frontier of growth comes from India, where it is building out a logistics network to be able to serve rural customers in India. However, AMZN has recently invested heavily in its fulfillment network by doubling it. ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-doubled-fulfillment-network-since-202622130.html)) So, I assumed that AMZN would slow down growth plans to capitalize on their new fulfillment network fully. India represents a very strong growth opportunity given the high smartphone penetration rate of India, the rapid growth of the Indian economy, and their large population ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/)), this culmination of factors makes India a very lucrative market for AMZN to expand in.  \nWhen forecasting Average Monthly Traffic, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.sellzone.com/the-state-of-amazon-2022-key-data-insights-trends-to-watch/)). I assumed that as AMZN\u2019s fulfillment network gets more comprehensive their monthly traffic increases as AMZN\u2019s value proposition increases. I assumed that AMZN expands its fulfillment network significantly every 5 years.  \nWhen forecasting Sales/Monthly Traffic, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN\u2019s sales/monthly traffic did not grow due to AMZN raising prices and only grew in line with the perpetual inflation rate. However, in the longer run as AMZN becomes more entrenched in these countries\u2019 consumer habits I assumed that AMZN has larger price-setting abilities.   \n\n\n***Third Party Sales (3P)***\r  \nThird Party Sales (3P) refers to the %sales AMZN earns as commission from third party sellers that sell on AMZN\u2019s website. \r  \n\r  \nThe appeal of AMZN to retailers is that retailers can reach a massive audience very easily and can glean valuable insights on their products from the tools that AMZN platforms provide. Listing on AMZN also adds a layer of credibility and convenience, especially for Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) sellers.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting 3P Gross Merchandise Value, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sales-top-700-billion-in-2023)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted GMV as a % of historic averages. As AMZN expands into more markets I expect this GMV to increase as there are now more sellers that are attracted to the services provided by AMZN.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting %GMV Earned, I assumed that AMZN slowly begin taking up a larger portion of the pie as AMZN would build a very strong value proposition to sellers and sellers would grow increasingly reliant on AMZN\u2019s platform. However, I assumed modest growth as AMZN has to remain attractive to sellers by not cutting too much into their margins.\n\n\r  \n***Advertising***  \nAdvertising refers to ad revenue AMZN earns from advertisers to advertise on AMZN\u2019s platform.  \nWhen forecasting Advertising, there is a lack of suitable data to forecast advertising, and the success of advertising hinges on the success of retail. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of retail revenue.  \n***Subscription***   \nSubscription refers to AMZN\u2019s subscription service, Amazon Prime.  \nWhen forecasting number of subscribers, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-prime-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20230%20million%20Amazon,through%20Prime%20membership%20in%202023)). I believe that NFLX is a very strong competitor having dedicated their entire business model exclusively to content acquisition and marketing compared to AMZN which has a lot of other businesses that they need to pay attention to. I believe a significant portion of subscribers are purchasing Prime Video as an add-on to Amazon Prime rather than just for Prime Video alone. On top of that, in foreign countries where local broadcasters are still in a strong position, it\u2019s tougher for AMZN to break into so I believe that Amazon Prime subscribers will not grow at an aggressive pace. In the past few years, with the backdrop of a poor macro-environment AMZN\u2019s subscribers numbers Y/Y growth rate declined evident that Amazon Prime is perceived as a luxury good or an item placed in low priority.  \nWhen forecasting churn rate, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://churnkey.co/blog/churn-rates-for-streaming-services/)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages. However, I believe that AMZN\u2019s churn rate is higher than it should be due to the influx of new subscribers trying out Amazon Prime for the first time. So, over time I believe that as consumers get used to using Amazon Prime and develop a reliance on the service I believe that the churn rate tends downwards. So I assumed that as AMZN enters into newer markets the value of Amazon Prime increases which incentivizes consumers to stay subscribed to Amazon Prime.   \nWhen forecasting Annual Revenue/Member, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN\u2019s Annual Revenue/Member did not grow due to AMZN raising prices in these countries and only in countries where AMZN has an established presence. So, this leads to the overall Y/Y growth rate being slower in the short run.\n\n***AWS***\r  \nAWS refers to AMZN\u2019s cloud computing services. AWS offers SAAS and IAAS.\r  \n\r  \nAWS has a strong first movers advantage, they started in 2006 whereas Google Cloud started in 2008 and Microsoft Azure started in 2010. I believe that AWS has had strong growth in recent history in part due to the chip shortage and a mass rush into AI Training that demanded a lot of chips, causing some companies to resort to renting more cloud GPUs from AMZN.\r  \n\r\n\nAMZN\u2019s Gen AI strategy has 3 layers. The first layer is targetting the training and inference market for AI. The second layer (Amazon Bedrock) offers large numbers of foundational LLM that businesses can use and develop according to their needs, allowing customers to experiment with different models to optimize experience and cost. The third layer is (Amazon Q) which functions similarly to ChatGPT.\r  \n\r  \nOthers\r  \nAMZN\u2019s other revenue sources. \r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Others, I forecasted it as a %retail sales as the success of Others hinges on the success of AMZN\u2019s retail arm of business. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\r\n\n# Reality Check:\n\nAs a reality check for my forecast, I looked at the world\u2019s GDP to figure out if the GMV for AMZN is in line with the total growth in goods and services in the world. As of 2023, AMZN\u2019s GMV as a %World GDP is 0.5%. By 2040, the world GDP is at 153T ([SOURCE](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-GDP-could-rise-by-about-12-trillion-in-2040-an-8-percent-increase-mainly-from_fig1_346806184#:~:text=NonCommercial%204.0%20International-,Global%20GDP%20could%20rise%20by%20about%20%2412%20trillion%20in%202040,health%3A%20A%20prescription%20for%20prosperity)), I assumed that AMZN\u2019s GMV as a %world GDP is 1.8%. This is realistic as over time, it would make sense for smaller players to sell their products on AMZN rather than rebuilding a new logistics network from the ground up. An example of smaller players using a much larger platform to sell is live stream commerce, which is prominent on platforms such as Douyin ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj8vaCGq4WFAxWO1jgGHaqNBEQQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F1174906%2Fchina-gmv-of-live-streaming-commerce-on-douyin%2F&usg=AOvVaw1RJ3TKxYD-m8lPZtrTMtRz&opi=89978449)).\r  \n\r  \nThe total world population as of 2023 is at 8.05 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)), and monthly Traffic as of 2023 as a % of the total world population is at 32.92%. By 2043, the world population will grow to 9.36 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-projections/)), I assumed that AMZN\u2019s monthly traffic as a %world population is 49.67%.\r  \n\r  \nI believe that these assessments are realistic given that I am expecting AMZN to expand its logistics network about 6x over 20 years, increasing its reach far beyond its domestic reach in the US. The speed of expansion is logical too given that AMZN was able to double its logistics network 2x over 2 years. \n\n# \rCost:\n\n***COGS***\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, Regionalization has reduced the distance needed by AMZN to deliver their item to customers, in turn saving cost. \r  \n\r  \n***G&A***\n\nWhen forecasting G&A, I took into account the number of employees. AMZN has been reducing headcount over the past few years, as AMZN overhired during COVID-19 to keep up with the raging demand. \r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Cost/Employee, as AMZN is in money-saving mode I assumed that they continued the historic trend of cutting down Cost/Employee for the next 2 years before growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\r  \n\r  \n***R&D***\n\nWhen forecasting R&D, R&D was capitalized. To determine the useful life I looked at what the majority of the spending was on, \u201cSoftware development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented.\u201d and  \u201cThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years.\u201d - 2023 Q4 10-K. So, I assumed that the main expenditure came from capitalized video content, and applying the conservatism principle, the amortization was rounded down to 3 years.\n\n# Change in NWC:\n\nWhen forecasting change in NWC as AMZN recently rolled out their regionalization efforts in FY23, the impact on Day Inventory may be very apparent and should be assumed as the status quo going forward.\n\n# D&A and CapEX:\n\n\rWhen forecasting Amortization and Content Amortization, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Content Acquisition and CapEX, I assumed that as AMZN expands its reach the CapEX spending increases before regressing to below historic averages. \n\n# WACC:\n\n\r\u201cThe weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\u201d - 2023 Q4 10-K   \n10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.31%  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/)) = 1.17  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  \nCOE = 9.69%  \nAMZN is rated \u201cAA-\u201d ([SOURCE](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-amazoncom-inc-at-aa-outlook-stable-20-06-2023))  \nAA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 5.03%  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  \nAT-COD = 3.97%  \nStock Price (5D Avg) = $173.97  \nShares O/S = 10387.38M  \nMarket Value of Equity = 1807092.50M  \nWeighted Average Maturity = 17.0 Years  \nFY23 Debt Obligation = 67150M  \nInterest Expense = 2081.65M  \nMarket Value of Debt = 60026.19M  \n%Debt = 3.21%  \n%Equity = 96.79%  \n%WACC = 9.48%  \n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value AMZN at $155.67 per share. I believe that AMZN is still overvalued despite it being a good company. This overvaluation of AMZN is a direct result of AMZN posting high free cash flow in recent quarters which gave investors the confidence that AMZN is capable of deriving positive free cash flow from its business. However, most of this positive cash flow was derived from their high margins AWS and advertising increasing substantially Y/Y. This could mean that positive cash flows are a cyclical occurrence as cloud computing is reliant on the volatile AI market and advertising is a cyclical industry that relies on macro-conditions. I believe that there is a strong case for AMZN to break beyond its current market valuation, but for it to be successful will be dependent on how the Indian market reacts to it and if AMZN is able to restart its push in the China market.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/dWsjmqX)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/WecSUn1)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/H3zKhuz)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/73hsmlL)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/SemPhpj)\\]  \nRevenue Model Part 2: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/lR8X6QO)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/oqqAydG)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/r5BJWdh)\\]  \nCapitalised R&D: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9V8QdXp)\\] ",

        "post_text": "I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

Last two earning have been bad due to high expectation, e-commerce demand has dropped since lockdown and higher labor cost eating into profit. (All well known facts)\n\nBut here is why you should look past all that, and adding more AMZN to your portfolio will payoff big time. If you look closely in their earnings report, they are spending like crazy in their logistic business this also includes last mile delivery and EV investment.\n\nThis is a company that generates revenue of over $400B a year, as soon as they make their operation more efficient and spending drops. Its going to generate amazing profit. \n\nOn top of this their selfdriving division Zoox is now running Level 3 autonomous in seattle and announcing project kuiper partnership with verizon. And ofc AWS is still growing over 30% which is nuts since they are already a market leader. \n\nBottomline is AMZN has lot of things going for at the moment and lot of catalyst can send this stock to moon. Here is my list\n\n* Improving profit margin (more automation, EV and Drone delivery)\n* Integrating Zoox and Project Kuiper with Prime\n* AWS still the top pick for new and growing business (duh)\n* Stock split (I believe this is still very much on the table",

I don't remember exactly what was going on inside the company at the time, but then, on 23 October 2014, it missed on earnings and the price \"plummeted\" the next day, trading in the 280s/290s.  \n\nOn that day, it just so happened that I was kind of stranded in the middle of Camp Pendleton with shyte signal, no computers anywhere nearby, and busy AF running a 75-person detachment on 24 hour operations.  It was only a coincidence that I saw the AMZN news because it had been reported in mainstream media and I got an alert on my phone.  I had been watching the company for a few months and thought to myself, what a great day to buy!  They will certainly recover, this company is solid.   \n\nSo I whip out my phone, but I didn't have my brokerage app installed... I've only had a smartphone for two years at this point and still wasn't comfortable putting my financial-related apps on there.  But I said to myself, screw it, you can't miss this opportunity.  So I try downloading the app... but, again, shyte signal... download failed.  Try again... download failed.  I tried this for about an hour until while things were quiet, then everything got busy again and I had to abandon my quest to download the app.  \n\nNext thing I know, market is closed, ahhh damn I missed my chance I say to myself.  I get home from camp Pendleton two weeks later and see that the price has now \"recovered\" to 300+ and I figure, oh well not going to buy it now.  \n\nYeah, so I know everyone has their \"one that got away\" but hot-damn it's not always so easy to pinpoint the moment in time when it happened.  And I would have held it... I'm a long-term investor.  So yeah, that's my unsolicited sob story.\n\nIn any case, I haven't learned my lesson because even though AMZN stock price will plummet again today due to missed earnings, I'm not going to buy it... I'll never be able to decouple my emotions from that stock, I'll just let my ETFs and MFs with AMZN holdings deal with it for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**; Exactly five years ago, AMZN missed on earnings and I missed a chance to buy it in the 280s because of no phone signal, then gave up hope when it increased to 300-something... like a moron.",

We saw significant growth in 2020, share price jumped from $1800 to over $3000 within a year. Since then it has been consolidating side ways. Even after delivering great 2020 Q4 and 2021 Q1 results. Even in Q2 beside the revenue miss, their most profitable business AWS and Ad grew by good %. But we are now back to mid end of the consolidation.\n\nI own MSFT, AAPL and GOOG. But my position is half of what AMZN is, because I just love this company and feel like they have lot of room for growth with disruptive products Self driving cars (zoox), Internet Satellite (Project Kuiper), store automation, increasing amazon warehouse margin by more automation and less workforce and obviously continuing the AWS success. They are operating at huge scale if the new CEO focuses on efficiency it would be game changing.\n\nI am sort of looking for confirmation bias if I should still keep AMZN as my top holding, or slowly reduce the position.

At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.\n\nWitnesses said workers were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find. \"I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,\" said Alexander Bird, who works at a warehouse across the street. \"People had to think on their feet quick.\" Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated, marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area. Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.\n\nIt was unclear how many workers were still missing, as Amazon did not have an exact count of people working in the sorting and delivery center at the time the tornadoes hit, Whiteford said. Colleagues and family members desperate for news about loved ones gathered outside the mess of concrete and steel. Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents. \"We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,\" she told Reuters. \n\nEarlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on Twitter that the company was \"heartbroken over the loss\" of its staff members and would continue to work closely with local authorities on the rescue efforts. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos echoed Jassy in a statement shared on Twitter later on Saturday, in which he pledged the company's support to the community. \"All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,\" Bezos wrote. The billionaire had been in Texas earlier in the day to greet astronauts, including the daughter of pioneering astronaut Alan Shepard and former NFL star Michael Strahan, as they returned from a space trip aboard his Blue Origin rocket.",

        "post_text": "Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice # HISTORY:\n\nThe story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN\u2019s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would\u2019ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn\u2019t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.\n\nTl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.\n\n# INTRODUCTION:\n\nAMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.\n\n1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.\n2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.\n3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.\n4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.\n5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.\n6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.\n\n# REVENUE:\n\n**AMZN store**:  \n2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, \"reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand.\" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.\n\nPast 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  \"more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.\" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.\n\nAMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  \n\n\n**AWS:**  \n2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, \"we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost\" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth \"more in the mid 20% growth rate\". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.\n\nAWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions \"launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific.\" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  \n\n\n**3P:**  \nI was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.\n\nOf course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.\n\nSo throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Subscription:**  \nSubscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, \"Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service\", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).\n\nSubscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.\n\nSo throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  \n\n\n**Advertising:**  \n2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.\n\nI won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.\n\nRegardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).\n\nI wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  \n\n\n# EBIT:\n\nAs per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, \"drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal.\" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.\n\nAMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.\n\nBut, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  \n\n\n# ASSUMPTIONS:\n\n1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.\n2. D&A taken to be 7% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 D&A with respect to revenue on average was 7%.\n3. Other Ops Exp/Inc and Deferred income tax was omitted from being forecasted despite appearing on the cash flow statement as they were too meager so I opted for less granularity and omitted them.\n4. Change in NWC taken to be -0.5% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 the average was -0.5%\n5. CapEX assumed to be 11% for the high growth period from 2022 - 2025. Before decreasing to reflect a maturing company. A picture of CapEX and D&A side by side: [https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF](https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF)   \npositive net asset balance was taken throughout forecast period.\n6. TGR taken to be 2%.\n7. WACC is taken at 9.2%, Calculations is as such.  \nReference taken from here: [https://imgur.com/a/yM8is8V](https://imgur.com/a/yM8is8V) when calculating %equity and %debt I took long term debt, other long term liability and total shareholder's equity.  \nCOD = taking AMZN\u2019s historic bond yield[(Market Insider,7)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/amazoncom_incdl-notes_201717-27-bond-2027-us023135bc96) and AA corporate bond yield average [(Ycharts,8)](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_corporate_aa_effective_yield#:~:text=Basic%20Info,long%20term%20average%20of%204.07%25) at 4.7%  \n%debt = (58919 + 22259)/ (58919 +22 259 + 137489) = 34%  \n%equity =  137489/(58919 +22 259 + 137489) = 66%  \nRisk Free Rate(RFR) = 3.6%, US 10Y Treasury Yield  \nMarket Beta = 1.34 taking the average from Aswath Damodaran (1.49) and Yahoo Finance(1.19)  \nRisk Premium = 5.94% taken from Aswath Damodaran (It's an EXCEL so I can't link it)  \nCOE = 11.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# QUESTIONS & NOTES:\n\n1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  \nAs per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, \"40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally.\" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.\n2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  \nAMZN\u2019s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.\n3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  \nData available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.\n4. **How much AMZN\u2019s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.\n5. **LASTLY,**   \nAll my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. \n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\nUltimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like \"Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?\" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   \nI see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.\n\nFor the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!\n\nScreenshot of my excel: [https://imgur.com/a/0QggSox](https://imgur.com/a/0QggSox)",

I feel like there\u2019s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who\u2019ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon\n\nIs there anyone out there that thinks that won\u2019t happen?\n\nI can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. \n\nBut we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they\u2019re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they\u2019re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?\n\nSame with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can\u2019t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). \n\nI know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion.

        "post_text": "How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40% I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\n*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. \n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

        "post_text": "Facebook scrambles to escape stock\u2019s death spiral as users flee, sales drop A year ago, before Facebook had turned [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META), the social media company was sporting a market cap of [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/facebook-hits-trillion-dollar-market-cap-for-first-time.html), putting it in rarefied territory with a handful of U.S. technology giants.\n\nToday the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.\n\nFacebook\u2019s business was built on network effects \u2014 users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company\u2019s ensuing profits \u2014 and they were plentiful \u2014 provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.\n\nBut in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook\u2019s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company\u2019s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.\n\nZuckerberg\u00a0[said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse \u201cwill reach a billion people\u201d and \u201chost hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.\u201d He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html)\u00a0CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer in June that the \u201cNorth Star\u201d is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a \u201cmassive economy\u201d around digital goods.\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t enthusiastic about it, and the way they\u2019re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can\u2019t recover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,\u201d said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.\n\nNobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.\n\nThe Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it\u2019s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019s known. The company\u2019s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.\n\nThe number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I\u2019m just worried that they\u2019re not winning the next generation,\u201d said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.\n\nSales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.\n\nMeta has been trying to mimic TikTok\u2019s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users\u2019 Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely \u201cget tremendous revenue flow from that\u201d algorithmic shift.\n\nHowever, Facebook acknowledges it\u2019s early days for monetizing Reels, and it\u2019s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok\u2019s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China\u2019s ByteDance.\n\n[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who\u2019s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very promising,\u201d Sandberg said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got some hard work ahead of us.\u201d\n\nSkeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn\u2019t strong enough to stand alone,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.\u201d\n\nA Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.\n\nZuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).\n\nThe 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook\u2019s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple\u2019s changes.\n\nThat may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn\u2019t solvable with AI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,\u201d said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. \u201cSocial networks are switchable, right?\u201d\n\nWhen you look at Meta\u2019s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is \u201cnot in a good position.\u201d\n\n## \u2018Force for good or evil\u2019\n\nThe last time Facebook\u2019s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).\n\nThe main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).\n\n[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including \u201cWhat Great Brands Do\u201d and \u201cFusion,\u201d said there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that Facebook\u2019s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.\n\n\u201cI think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,\u201d Yohn said.\n\nRehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino\u2019s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company\u2019s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.\n\nIn December 2009, Domino\u2019s launched a marketing blitz called the [\u201cPizza Turnaround.\u201d](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nYohn said the company\u2019s approach was, \u201cWe\u2019ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we\u2019re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people\u2019s perceptions.\u201d While it sounded initially like \u201cjust marketing speak,\u201d Yohn said, \u201cthey actually really did change.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg, on the other hand, is not \u201ccoming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he\u2019s envisioning,\u201d she said.\n\nMeta\u2019s reputational hit could also harm the company\u2019s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.\n\nA former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it\u2019s viewed as having less \u201cmoral downside.\u201d\n\n[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he\u2019s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.\n\nIn order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are \u201chaving to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.\u201d\n\n## The bull case\n\nStill, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nDollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company\u2019s ability to move \u201cfrom the PC to the mobile world.\u201d Facebook\u2019s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse.

Of the other five companies, with $41.8 billion at the end of last quarter, META has the lowest level of cash and equivalents.\n\nNFLX had $21.57 billion in content obligations at the end of last quarter, and $4.3 billion of that will be spent within the next year. Herein lies a major stumbling block for me when I consider NFLX as an investment.\n\nCompetition within streaming companies results in enormous capex devoted to content creation. It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers, and that includes the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, each of which is now in competition with NFLX.\n\nHowever, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have a great deal of FCF to potentially devote to content efforts. For example, Alphabet generated $69.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Trailing 12-month free cash flow for NFLX was a relatively paltry $717 million in 3Q22.\n\nFurthermore, while the other five FAANMG\u2019s have investment grade credit ratings, Moody's still rates NFLX at Ba1/positive, a notch below investment grade.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 price targets support my observations. The average 12-month price target for META, AAPL, and MSFT are each roughly 30% higher than the current share prices. AMZN and GOOGL have price targets that are 66% and 61.7% above the current share valuations, respectively.\n\nNFLX? Analysts give that stock an upside of 1.3%.",

Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.  \nGoogle Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the \u201cstrong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,\u201d  \nCEO Sundar Pichai said that \u201cgreater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,\u201d and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud\u2019s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google\u2019s \u201cTPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.\u201d  \n**Is Alphabet monetizing AI?

There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).\n\nGoogle also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as \"the place to go for long-form video watching.\" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. \n\n**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.\n\nGoogle's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.\n\nThe **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.\n\n**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.\n\nGoogle has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. \n\nGoogle is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.\n\nGoogle also has several different speculative \"moonshots\" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an \"unconventional\" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.\n\nHence, why I like the GOOG and GOOGL stock :)",

        "post_text": "Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.\n\nThe move would be Washington\u2019s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.\n\nRegardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google\u2019s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.\n\nThe Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta\u2019s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government\u2019s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.\n\nAlphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.\n\nA Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.\n\nThe US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.\n\nJustice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google\u2019s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company\u2019s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google\u2019s AI products in order to appear in search results.\n\n**Breakup**\n\nDivesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that\u2019s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.\n\nThose agreements also require that Google\u2019s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can\u2019t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.\n\nMehta\u2019s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn\u2019t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn\u2019t be allowed \u201cto reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.\u201d\n\nGoogle paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.\n\nMehta\u2019s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google\u2019s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year\u2019s trial.\n\nIf the Justice Department doesn\u2019t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.\n\n**Data Access**\n\nAnother option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta\u2019s ruling found that Google\u2019s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data \u2013 16 times as much as its next closest competitor \u2014 but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.\n\nEurope\u2019s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.\n\nRequiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department\u2019s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.\n\nIn the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.\n\n**AI Products**\n\nFor years, websites have allowed Google\u2019s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company\u2019s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.\n\nLast fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn\u2019t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with \u201cAI Overviews,\u201d narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.\n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a \u201cfeature\u201d of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.\n\nWhile AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature\u2019s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win",

I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.\n\nPrevious generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.\n\nWith recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).\n\nThese observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.\n\nThe fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.\n\nCost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",

The S&P 500 traded 4.3% lower, the biggest drop since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.9%, the largest fall in the tech-heavy index since May 5. The selling was broad and intense on Wall Street with just 13 members of the S&P 500 in the green.\n\nMarkets returned to heavy selling after two back-to-back quarterly reports from Target and Walmart stoked investor fears of rising inflation. It\u2019s the fifth Dow decline of more than 800 points this year, which all occurred as the stock sell-off intensified within the last one month, according to FactSet data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that transportation costs matter and they\u2019re impacting [some of] the largest companies,\u201d said Kim Forrest, founder of Bokeh Capital. \u201cSo I think investors are scratching our heads going, \u2018so, who\u2019s next?\u2019 And they\u2019re giving visibility into what\u2019s happening with the consumer.\u201d\n\nTarget shares tumbled more than 27% Wednesday after the retailer reported first-quarter earnings that were much lower than Wall Street estimated because of higher costs for fuel and compensation. The retailer also saw lower-than-expected sales for discretionary merchandise like TVs.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s report comes right after Walmart on Tuesday posted earnings that fell short of expectations as it too cited higher fuel and labor costs. Walmart shares ended Tuesday lower by 11%. They were down another 7% on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe consumer is challenged,\u201d said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. \u201cWe started to see at the end of the year that consumers were turning to credit cards to pay for the rise in food prices, rise in energy prices, and that\u2019s actually gotten much worse. ...

The only two reasons I can think of is laziness and/or confusion.

        "post_text": "Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis **NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**\n\n# Introduction:\n\nGOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.\n\n# Revenue:\n\nThe success of GOOG\u2019s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.\n\n***For attracting and retaining users,***\n\n1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.\n2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.\n3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).\n\n***For monetizing advertisers,***\n\n1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.\n\nApart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).\n\nHow GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.\n\nWhen forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG\u2019s advertising tools.\n\nSo, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.\n\nWhen forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I\u2019m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I\u2019d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I\u2019d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I\u2019d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn\u2019t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG\u2019s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.\n\n# Cost:\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.\n\nWhen forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\nWhen forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I\u2019d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.\n\n# WACC:\n\nRFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%\n\nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06\n\nStable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%\n\nCOE = 9.02%\n\nGOOG has a bond rating of AA ([SOURCE](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Google-Inc-credit-rating-820429365?lang=es-ar&cy=arg#:~:text=Moody's%20assigns%20Aa2%20rating%20to%20Google's%20senior%20unsecured%20debt))\n\nAA bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.80%\n\nMarginal Tax rate = 21.00%\n\nAT-COD = 3.79%\n\nStock price (5D Avg) = $147.05\n\nShares O/S = 12433M\n\nMarket Value of Equity = 1828272.65M\n\nWeighted Average Debt = 10 Years\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 308M\n\nMarket Value of Debt = 12769.72M\n\n%Debt = 0.007%\n\n%Equity = 99.003%\n\nWACC = 8.93%\n\n# \n\nConclusion:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/N5sTEUE)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/H6Nwjmt)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9MQJ5r5)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/f1BVoRa)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/q9kjjCf)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/tmtlB4d)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/TcRANOP)\\]",

        "post_text": "I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned. Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.\n\nI had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.\n\nTo celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\n**I can't predict the stock market.**\n\n*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.\n\nYou can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street.

The move will limit some scenarios where long chat sessions can \u201cconfuse\u201d the chat model, the company said in a blog post. The change comes after early beta testers of the chatbot, which is designed to enhance the Bing search engine, found that it could go off the rails and discuss violence, declare love, and insist that it was right when it was wrong. In a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft blamed long chat sessions of over 15 or more questions for some of the more unsettling exchanges where the bot repeated itself or gave creepy answers.\n\nFor example, in one chat, the Bing chatbot told technology writer Ben Thompson: I don\u2019t want to continue this conversation with you. I don\u2019t think you are a nice and respectful user. I don\u2019t think you are a good person. I don\u2019t think you are worth my time and energy. Now, the company will cut off long chat exchanges with the bot. Microsoft\u2019s blunt fix to the problem highlights that how these so-called large language models operate is still being discovered as they are being deployed to the public. Microsoft said it would consider expanding the cap in the future and solicited ideas from its testers. It has said the only way to improve AI products is to put them out in the world and learn from user interactions.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s aggressive approach to deploying the new AI technology contrasts with the current search giant, Google, which has developed a competing chatbot called Bard, but has not released it to the public, with company officials citing reputational risk and safety concerns with the current state of technology. Google is enlisting its employees to check Bard AI\u2019s answers and even make corrections, CNBC previously reported.",

I'm only a beginner so bare with me I would just like some help with understand the growth of these stocks before I commit to investing\n\n\nGoogle - it's one of the most successful companies in the world each year their revenue increases significantly. However they are trading at high valuation which means the market is expecting high growth which might be true but is this likely? If they already have a monopoly in this sector (outside China) where will the additional growth come from? Ad revenue is the main one but as entrenched as they are it feels like therr are vulnerable points like changes in regulation or technology which makes advertising less valuable etc etc.From my limited understanding they are invested in other sectors too such as AI so what is the expected growth in this sector and what percentage would google take? \n\n\n\nApple - Smartphone giants, smartphones seem like they will always be a huge part of society. Also apple are looking into other sectors such as TV or electric cars. However if smart phone are only increasing 2% that would mean if Apple were to grow beyond 2% per year they would need to take market share from their competitors\n\n\n\nAMD - Not sure if the valuation is high or not. I believe they are in a duopoly with nvidea and they have around 15% of the sector. I think their valuation may be high so again I'm guessing people on here expect the chip market to grow substantially while mainting their market share? How realistic is this and what differentiates them from nvidea?",

That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo\u2019s waitlist.\n\nWith more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company\u2019s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.\n\n\u201cNow is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,\u201d Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. \u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We\u2019re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can\u2019t wait to serve more riders soon.\u201d\n\nThe company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.\n\nWaymo closed a\u00a0$5.6 billion funding round\u00a0in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.\n\nThe robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That\u2019s up from 100,000 in August.\n\nWaymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a\u00a0Geely Zeekr\u00a0that\u2019s equipped with custom sensors and an AI \u201cdriver.\u201d Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic\u00a0partnership with Hyundai\u00a0that will add the South Korean automaker\u2019s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.\n\nThe Waymo One service has\u00a0been embraced\u00a0by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their\u00a0teens to school.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html)",

Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.\n\nThanks for the awards.",

It\u2019s down about 15% since Tuesday, from what I believe was already an appealing price. I\u2019d say the same for Qualcomm. \n\nThe broadest and likely \u201csafest\u201d are going to be TSM and QQQ. Personally I\u2019m in a position where I\u2019m deep in TSM and TQQQ, hedged with INTC. \n\nI\u2019d like to add that I believe these tickers will all run downward a bit longer.

        "post_text": "How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40% I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\n*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. \n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

        "post_text": "Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation **I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.\n\nLast evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.\n\nI believe analysts\u2019 consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.\n\nGoogle's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.\n\n* It has a near monopoly in Search\n* Market leadership in media with YouTube.\n* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.\n* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.\n\n**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**\n\nLet's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.\n\nQ3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**\n\nRevenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.\n\nGoogle Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.\n\n**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.\n\nCloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.\n\nBased on consensus analysts\u2019 estimates Alphabet\u2019s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that\u2019s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple\u2018s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google\u2019s 22. Alphabet\u2019s P/E is closer to the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 21!\n\nI believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.\n\nBesides the strong EPS, a lot of Google\u2019s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.\n\nThe antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.\n\n**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",

I already put about $7k of it into 50 NVIDIA, $2.6k into 100 Palantir, and $480 into 100 RKLB. Was wondering what would be good to invest the remaining $4.9k? I am undecided if I should top off any of the ones I just purchased today (thought about increasing RKLB to 1000 shares if things look bright for the future) or consider diversifying further. I have also been looking at AVGO, ASML, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG. What are some thoughts on these for long term? Or any others that you would recommend?",

PYPL - Currently trading at a price it hasn't seen since 2018, and is at the lowest P/E in its entire history. The last time the P/E was anywhere near this low was back in 2016. At that time PYPL's EPS was $1\\`.11. It's now at $3.03. So it's trading at levels not seen in years but is earning triple what it was earning back then.\n2. GOOG - Currently trading at the lowest P/E in more than 7 years. It came close to this level back in 2019, when it was earning $49.50/share. It's now earning $110.50, more than double what it was earning then.\n3. DOCU - Currently trading at a P/S of 6.3. The last time it was at this sales ratio was back in 2019, pre-COVID. At that time it was generating $7.84/share in revenue. It's now generating $10.70/share. Gross margins are higher now too.\n4. CHWY - Currently trading below its IPO price at the dirt cheap P/S of 1.1. The previous lowest P/S was 3.2, back at the IPO when it was generating $13.40/share in revenue. It's now generating $21.30/share in revenue on higher gross margins.\n\nBottom line: there are some companies out there trading at or below past levels despite generating considerably more earnings or sales now than they were back then. The unprofitable ones will rebound more slowly, but these are the higher quality companies that the smart money will start snapping up when it looks like the dust is settling. So be ready.",

Tesla\u2019s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.\u2019s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.\u2019s GM Cruise.\n\n\n\nWith Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.\u2019s BIDU Apollo Go.\n\n\n\nJohnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla\u2019s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is \u201csuspect.\u201d In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. \u201cIn fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nWhile the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. \u201cThe most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,\u201d it added.\n\n\n\nJohnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**\n\n  \nData reported by competitors to the California\u00a0Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:\n\n* Waymo: 17,311 miles\n* **Amazon, Inc.\u2019s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles\n* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles\n* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles\n\nThe **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI\u2019s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn\u2019t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  \n\n\n**Why It\u2019s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla\u2019s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the \u201cliability of putting something this dangerous on roads.\u201d\n\n  \nAccording to Ark\u2019s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla\u2019s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.\n\nFuture Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30\n\n  \nSource: [benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41047267/safety-disaster-tesla-fsd-galaxies-away-from-being-anywhere-close-to-competition-says-bearish-analys)",

        "post_text": "Google(GOOG) DCF: AI # Introduction:\n\nWith all the hype around AI and NVDA, this could be a strong catalyst for launching GOOG into its intrinsic value. Most of the climb had already taken place over the weeks. But, given that currently AI is the flavor of the month I'd be a little worried about adding more positions into GOOG. As a disclaimer, I have positions on GOOG since last year that I've been closing out and cashing in on my gains. I've linked my DCF, Revenue model and Cost model all at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# REVENUE:\n\n\r  \n***Cloud***\r  \n%Rev, Cloud is an area gaining massive traction due to how much convenience it adds, And the switching cost of cloud is massive, having to port over the entire database into competitors and retraining employees, so the loyalty of Cloud customers are strong. \r  \nSo, I\u2019d argue that Cloud starts becoming a big part of GOOG\u2019s identity.\r  \n\r  \nY/Y, Cloud grows at CAGR of 19% according to ([SOURCE](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/news/cloud-computing-market-size-is-projected-to-surpass-usd-2972-6)). I believe GOOG to be capable of capturing most of that 19%. But, 19% may be overly optimistic as it requires for the next 8 years about 40+% Y/Y which seems unrealistic to me, given how cloud is already such a large part of GOOG. So I used a Y/Y CAGR of 13.32%\r  \n\r  \n***Advertising***\r  \n%Rev, Advertising is still going to be a big part of GOOG\u2019s identity, however with cloud gaining traction Advertising's role may be diminished.   \n\r  \nY/Y, Advertising will see its Y/Y tapering off rather than taking off. I\u2019d argue that the growth of AI related technology like ChatGPT may render GOOG\u2019s search less effective given how ChatGPT seems to be an enhanced Google Search. Luckily, GOOG's has its own contender of ChatGPT, Bard. Bard is trained on Audio data whereas ChatGPT is trained on text data, so the effectiveness of these AI is dependent on how the user inputs data for the AI to process. Ultimately, which AI will take off is dependent on which modal of communication consumers prefer. \r  \nRecently, GOOG has announced its plans to launch Duet AI, AI to help augment the experience on both cloud and Search. It\u2019s definitely a step forward in the right direction, Duet AI could be complementary to Google\u2019s already dominant search as not every search will likely be using AI due to how long that would take. \r  \n\r  \n***Others***\r  \n%Rev, With so many components in Others, there may be less focus placed on this segment of the business so it\u2019ll take a smaller pie of GOOG\u2019s revenue.  \n\r  \nY/Y, I opted to use historical average as granularity seems to be inaccurate here.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n# \r\r\r\rCOST:\n\n\r***TAC***\r  \nGiven the competitiveness of Competing technology against GOOG\u2019s main Traffic generator, I\u2019d argue that it could be significantly costlier to acquire traffic overtime. Recently I've been reading Homo Deus which made a fair point about Dataism. As our data interpreter (AI) gets more and more accurate, you'd be at a disadvantage to not use AI in your day to day life. So if we have this paradigm shift of trusting and relying on AI, TAC has a huge potential of decreasing. But, given how little regulation and promising technology on AI there has been so far this may be either too far out into the future or just impossible entirely.\r  \n\r  \n***COST OF REVENUES***\r  \nGOOG has lumped Content Review, Content Acquisition and Data Centre together in COST OF REVENUES.  \n\r  \n1. Content Review: Needing Employees to manually sieve through content for compliance. As the service gets more popular, more content means needing more employees. (Variable Cost) BUT I'd argue that it could be a negligible one overtime as AI gains dominance and can track content in place of humans. (Fixed Cost)  \n\r  \n2. Content Acquisition: GOOG has stated it uses a cost price model for determining the amount of content acquired. (Variable Cost)  \n\r  \n3. Data Centre: Fixed infrastructure in place, but more of Data center used means GOOG needs higher bandwidth which means higher cost (Variable Cost)\r  \nSince these are variable costs, I\u2019d argue the extent that GOOG can reduce these costs to improve margins are limited.\r  \n\r  \n***R&D***\r  \nR&D the cornerstone of GOOG\u2019s business philosophy will always retain a fixed % of revenue. As evident from historic data where the spread of R&D with respect to Revenue was rather small.\r  \nSo, R&D maintains a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures, I\u2019d argue that R&D tends downwards.\r  \n\r  \n***Sales & Marketing + G&A***\r  \nSales & Marketing + G&A also followed the same historic patterns of R&D where they always occupied the same % with respect to revenue with a small spread.\r  \nSo, Sales & Marketing + G&A occupies a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures and develops a strong branding relies less on marketing so it tends downwards a little.   \n\n\n# \rCOST OF CAPITAL:\n\nWACC calculation a little too messy to input here so I'll link it   \nWACC: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/D48GrJl))\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\n\r  \nGOOG is priced at $146.02, GOOG\u2019s recent innovations have been made only in response to competitors. It\u2019s more reactive rather than proactive which may be a bad thing given how strongly ChatGPT has since established its dominance over GOOG. For GOOG to improve its valuation it needs to peer deeper into the AI realm and look towards augmenting AI to compliment its advertising segment e.g. Using AI to help advertisers or to manage Ad Inventory.   \n\n\nDCF: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/LiT2bkT))  \nREVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/t1ANWPo))  \nCOST MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/5CZx1r2))",

        "post_text": "Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%) Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity\n\nOver the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\n\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.\n\nThe China Worry\n\nApple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.\n\nWhile the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.\n\nThe current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.\n\nInvestors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on \"boosting domestic demand.\"\n\nIn other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.\n\nAll of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.\n\nA strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.\n\nA Robust Product Pipeline\n\nSteve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't \"a product guy.\" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.\n\nOnly three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.\n\nThis is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.\n\nApple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.\n\nHistory is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.\n\nIn short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.\n\nA Compelling Valuation\n\nOver the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.\n\nOverlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.\n\nAnalysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.\n\nOf the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.\n\nNormally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.\n\nSome investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?\n\nWe're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.\n\n\nIn the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.\n\nNow, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIt isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).\n\nApple really is that good.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.\n\nApple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.\n\nFears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.\nApple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.\n\nThere currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.\n\nWe believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",

Been thinking of whether I should trim my apple or google positions and honestly...feeling kinda bearish on Google.\n\nGoogle has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).\n\n Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?\n\nApple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot. And road ahead seems more clearer to me than Google's. \n\n\nSeems like AAPL just has more growth opportunities left in it and has superior company culture.

        "post_text": "1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left. *Introduction*\n\nI'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.\n\nIn the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.\n\nI maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.\n\nI've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.\n\n*Portfolio distribution*\n\n* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*\n* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*\n* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)\n* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER\n* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**\n\nnote: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*\n\nI sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.\n\nI'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *\"fear of missing out\"* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.\n\n*Income, expenses & conditions*\n\nMy monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.\n\n*The Missing piece*\n\nWhat i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer.",

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named \"Stargate.\" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.\r  \n\r  \nLINK:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-planning-$100-billion-data-center-project-the-information-reports  \n",

OpenAI also expects to spend about $200B through the end of the decade, minus stock compensations.

Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. \n\nCook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. \n\n\u201cIf you remove that $5 billion from last year\u2019s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.\u201d \n\nApple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year\u2019s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  \n\nMac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment\u2019s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company\u2019s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  \n\nOther Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. \n\nDuring the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple\u2019s major product lines.  \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only scratching the surface there so we couldn\u2019t be more excited about our opportunity there,\u201d Cook said. \n\nApple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  \n\nCook also said Apple has \u201cbig plans to announce\u201d from an \u201cAI point of view\u201d during its iPad event next week as well as at the company\u2019s annual developer conference in June.  \n\nServices was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That\u2019s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple\u2019s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  \n\nSales in Greater China, Apple\u2019s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  \n\n\u201cI feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,\u201d Cook said. \n\nCook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. \u201cThat may come as a surprise to some people,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nIn addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple\u2019s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple\u2019s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.  \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2024.html",

Assuming you can only buy one of the three and that you are not interested in something like QQQ.  Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.\n\nNVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).\n\nGOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.\n\nMSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.  Video games are also rather competitive with PS5 having great games so far, and Switch also not being shabby.\n\n**EDIT**  Thanks, all.

They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.\n\nWell, let's look at the data shall we...\n\nHere are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:\n\nVGT: +32.99% (Technology)  \nXLF: +34.87% (Financial)  \nXLE: +47.15% (Energy)  \nXLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  \nXLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  \nDBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  \nPAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  \nAVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  \nSCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  \nSMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  \nITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  \nTRVL: +6.82% (Travel)\n\nAs can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.\n\nSo can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.

        "post_text": "I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best. I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven\u2019t counted it up, but it\u2019s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades & Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

How many employers are going to pay extra for these features is the near future? My company has blocked most things AI citing fears of client data leaks and misuse. (co-piot, bing chat)\n2. How big of a revenue boost will this really be? There is a lot of computational hardware in use behind the scenes. If you have power users hitting this all day how much is being kept in profit?\n3. Azure Open AI seems to have some good use cases, but a lot of the demonstrated cases are around chat bots. Are chat bots worth a 35X + multiplier on this 2 trillion plus stock?\n\nMy view is more that MSFT has to do this to ensure they stay in the game not that this will be a major major revenue driver. For a company this large thinking PE of 35 is a bit lofty. But then again I've been reminded by some that MR Market tends to throw fundamentals to the wind when the hype gets big and we can grow into this multiplier...it just might be a bit.",

The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.\n\nApple\u2019s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.\n\nApple\u2019s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.\n\nApple\u2019s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.\n\nAnd Nikkei Asia reports that Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.\n\nStay ahead of the market\nBut Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel\u2019s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.\n\nAnd then there are reports about Apple\u2019s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.\n\nApple\u2019s rise to $3 trillion hasn\u2019t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it \u201ccomplies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.\u201d\n\nLike its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, \u201cFortnite\u201d maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.\n\nWhile the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.\n\nThe company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple\u2019s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.\u201d",

I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html)\n\nThere is one area that will benefit astronomically from AI but that will come a bit later.",

        "post_text": "Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.\n\nIt follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.\n\nThe standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.\n\n\"The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,\" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. \"The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.\"\n\nThe headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)",

        "post_text": "Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine? Hi guys!\n\nToday I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.\n\n**Business**\n\nMicrosoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.\n\nTheir operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!\n\n**Productivity and Business Processes**\n\nThis segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. \n\nOffice saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.\n\nLinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. \n\nThink about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.\n\nFinally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.\n\n**Intelligent Cloud** \n\nThis is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! \n\nIf you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.\n\n**Personal Computing**\n\nThis segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. \n\nI don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.\n\n**Business TL;DR**\n\nFuture growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.\n\n**Revenues**\n\nMicrosoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. \n\nSwitching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. \n\n**Margins**\n\nMicrosoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.\n\n**Assets/Liabilities**\n\n||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|\n\nMicrosoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.\n\n**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**\n\nAs of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends and has netted shareholders billions. \n\n**Price Ratios/Other**\n\n|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|\"Good Value\" for Sector|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|\n|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|\n|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|\n|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|\n|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\\>25%|\n|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|\n|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|\n\n**PE Ratio**\n\nI said a \"good\" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.\n\n**P/B Ratio**\n\nI said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.\n\n**P/S Ratio**\n\nI thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.\n\n**P/FCF Ratio**\n\nI identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. \n\n**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**\n\nMicrosoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.\n\nApple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.\n\nGoogle: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. \n\nAmazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.\n\nOverall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.\n\n**Moderate DCF Valuation**\n\nAssuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).\n\n**Bull Case**\n\nIn my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).\n\nI think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nDon't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!\n\nIn this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).\n\nI find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.\n\n**Risks**\n\n1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.\n2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.\n3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.\n4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nWhile Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.",

        "post_text": "I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned. Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.\n\nI had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.\n\nTo celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\n**I can't predict the stock market.**\n\n*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.\n\nYou can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)",

I bought them when they were really cheap in October 2022 and have held them since for some great returns.

In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems\n      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\\_logic\\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.\n      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\\_and\\_logical\\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).\n      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Robotic process automation**\n   * **Blue Prism - $PRSM - Need DD**\n   * **UiPath - $UIPTH (IPO later this year)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Semi-Conductors:**\n   * **ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML)** \\- From u/MikeJamesBurry the most important Europe Stock.

Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably.

The crowd reaction was like, \u201cSeriously, Apple? That\u2019s it?\u201d\n* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn\u2019t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.\n* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren\u2019t having it. Apple\u2019s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say \u201cAI fail.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.\n* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn\u2019t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they\u2019re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.\n* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple\u2019s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.\n\nLooks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT\u2019s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.\n\n**My Strategy**\u00a0\n\n**Technical Setup:**\u00a0\n\n* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55.\u00a0\n* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67.\u00a0\n\n**Entry Points:**\u00a0\n\n* Short-Term: I\u2019m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio.\u00a0\n* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it\u2019s a strong buy for long-term holding.\u00a0\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\u00a0\n\n* Short-Term Gains: I\u2019m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets.\u00a0\n* Long-Term Hold: I\u2019m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays\u2019 more bullish target.\u00a0\n\n**Risk Management:**\u00a0\n\n* Monitor Financial News: I\u2019ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases.\u00a0\n* Adjust Stops: I\u2019ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains.\u00a0\n\n**The Bottom Line**\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. I\u2019ll stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s to making smart moves! \ud83e\udd42\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

        "post_text": "U.S. lawmakers traded an estimated $355 million of stock last year. These were the biggest buyers and sellers Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades, buying and selling shares of companies based in the U.S. and around the world. At least 113 lawmakers have disclosed stock transactions that were made in 2021 by themselves or family members, according to a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures and MarketWatch reporting. U.S. lawmakers bought an estimated $180 million worth of stock last year and sold $175 million.\n\nThe trading action taking place in both the House and the Senate comes as some lawmakers push for a ban on congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. Stock trading is a bipartisan activity in Washington, widely conducted by both Democrats and Republicans, the disclosures show. Congress as a whole tended to be slightly bullish last year with more buys than sells as the S&P 500 SPX soared and returned 28.4%. Republicans traded a larger dollar amount overall \u2014 an estimated $201 million vs. Democrats\u2019 $154 million. \n\nSo who were the biggest traders? The table below, based on a Capitol Trades analysis, shows the 41 members of Congress who made stock buys or sells in 2021 with an estimated value of at least $500,000 \u2014 or had family members who made such trades.\n\nAt the top of the list of the biggest traders on Capitol Hill by dollar volume is Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, who disclosed an estimated $31 million in stock buys and $35 million in stock sales. He\u2019s followed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California with $34 million in estimated purchases and $19 million in sales, GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee with $26 million in estimated buys and $26 million in sells, and Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state with $15 million in estimated buys and $31 million in sells.\n\nCongress\u2019s more than 500 members are required to file disclosures within 45 days for any transactions involving stocks and other securities due to 2012\u2019s STOCK Act, though many lawmakers have been late with their filings. The decade-old law, which aims to help prevent politicians from profiting from nonpublic information, is viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups, especially given how a divided Washington united to weaken the law in 2013 by removing provisions such as one that required putting the disclosures in a searchable database. Independent analysis firms have ended up offering such databases, with 2iQ Research, for example, launching Capitol Trades last year. For the table above, Capitol Trades estimated the value of buys and sells using the midpoint of the declared range for the transaction. Lawmakers aren\u2019t required to disclose a transaction\u2019s exact value, but rather give ranges such as $1,001 to $15,000, or $15,001 to $50,000. McCaul\u2019s biggest disclosed trades in 2021 include sales by a child and his spouse of shares in Cullen/Frost Bankers CFR, a bank headquartered in McCaul\u2019s state, as well as sales by his spouse of shares of China\u2019s Tencent Holdings TCEHY, according to filings aggregated by Capitol Trades. The Texas congressman\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. His father-in-law is the founder of media giant Clear Channel, now known as iHeartMedia IHRT, and McCaul has ranked as one of the wealthiest U.S. lawmakers.\n\nKhanna\u2019s biggest trades included purchases by his spouse of shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Microsoft MSFT, along with purchases by a child of shares in Apple AAPL, communications company RingCentral RNG and Facebook parent Meta Platforms FB. The California congressman\u2019s spokeswoman said he \u201cdoes not own any individual stocks and complies fully with the Ban Conflicted Trading Act, which would prohibit lawmakers from buying or selling individual stocks.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to legislation that has attracted 35 co-sponsors in the House and three in the Senate. \u201cThese are his wife\u2019s assets prior to marriage and managed by an outside financial advisor. No trading is done through joint accounts,\u201d Khanna\u2019s spokeswoman also said.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-lawmakers-traded-an-estimated-355-million-of-stock-last-year-these-were-the-biggest-buyers-and-sellers-11643639354?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-lawmakers-traded-an-estimated-355-million-of-stock-last-year-these-were-the-biggest-buyers-and-sellers-11643639354?mod=home-page)",

Here are the results for this week I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.\n\n# Most Hyped Stock Threads\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Title|Tickers|Avg Hype %|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[GME shorts get crushed as explained by Cramer ... big WSB shout out, the first of two in the show tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhitu/gme_shorts_get_crushed_as_explained_by_cramer_big/)|GME|300+%|\n|[Tesla passes Facebook to become fifth most valuable U.S. company](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kt4dsy/tesla_passes_facebook_to_become_fifth_most/)|FB, TSLA|300+%|\n|[Citi wants a war?

        "post_text": "Sharing my top companies with you. I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.\n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.\n\n**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.\n\n**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.\n\n**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.\n\n**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.\n\n**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.\n\n**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

That is on par with [Samsung\u2019s own guidance of approximately 63 trillion Korean won](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-earnings-guidance-for-first-quarter-2023) but below the 63.9 trillion won expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates.  \n>  \n>**Operating profit:** 640 billion Korean won (roughly $478.55 million), down from 14.12 trillion won a year earlier. The company [issued guidance earlier this month](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-earnings-guidance-for-first-quarter-2023) saying Q1 profit would be 600 billion Korean won.  \n>  \n>This is the company\u2019s lowest operating profit since the first quarter of 2009.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Samsung sees memory recovery ahead**  \n>  \n>Traditionally, Samsung\u2019s biggest profit driver is its semiconductor division which consists of sales of memory chips that go into everything from personal computers to smartphones to servers in data centers.  \n>  \n>Samsung posted a 4.58 trillion Korean won loss at its semiconductor business versus a 8.45 trillion won profit in the same period last year.  \n>  \n>During the pandemic, smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips as demand for consumer devices increased, but they are now grappling with excess inventories as consumers cut back on purchases of these goods due to rising inflation. This has led to a fall in prices for the memory chips that Samsung sells.  \n>  \n>The South Korean giant said this month [it would be making a \u201cmeaningful\u201d](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/samsung-electronics-says-first-quarter-profit-likely-plunged-96percent-as-chip-glut-slashes-prices.html) cut in memory chip production, following the lead of smaller rivals such as SK Hynix and Micron.  \n>  \n>\u201cSamsung Electronics announced the disappointing number for the first quarter, but at the same time, they announced a meaningful production cut amid the severe memory chip downturn. After that, the market reacted positively on the news,\u201d SK Kim of Daiwa Securities Capital Markets told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Asia\u201d on Thursday.  \n>  \n>Samsung did however forecast a recovery in the second-half of the year.  \n>  \n>\u201cDemand is expected to gradually recover in 2H amid projections that customer inventory levels will have declined,\u201d Samsung said.  \n>  \n>[Samsung said it expects limited demand recovery](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2023-results) as large-scale data centers invest more conservatively and customers continue to adjust inventories. Samsung also expects launches of new smartphones, PC promotions and expansion of new CPU adoption to boost memory chip demand.  \n>  \n>SK Hynix, a competitor to Samsung, [also guided for a recovery in memory chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/sk-hynix-reports-record-quarterly-operating-loss-forecasts-better-outlook.html) when it reported a record quarterly loss on Wednesday,  \n>  \n>\u201cIf we got a rebound, it\u2019s mostly driven by the production cut and some restocking demand. So we see, despite the disappointing earnings number, some positive investor sentiment on the stock,\u201d said Kim.  \n>  \n>Samsung\u2019s stock was around 0.6% higher on Thursday.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**S23 Ultra gives mobile a boost**  \n>  \n>During the first quarter, Samsung launched its latest lines of flagship [smartphones called the S23 series](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/samsung-galaxy-s23-smartphone-lineup-to-take-on-apples-iphone-14.html), which gave its mobile division a boost.  \n>  \n>Revenue at its mobile business grew 22% versus the previous quarter to 30.74 trillion won, but was down 2% versus the same period last year. Operating profit came in at 3.94 trillion won, up 3% year-on-year.  \n>  \n>Samsung was helped by sales of its highest priced smartphone \u2014 the $1,200 S23 Ultra.  \n>  \n>\u201cThe premium market grew in terms of both volume and value even amid weak smartphone demand caused by lingering macro uncertainties,\u201d Samsung said in a statement. \u201cSales grew and profitability recovered to reach double-digits on the back of strong sales of new premium models, centering on S23 Ultra, and efforts to enhance operational efficiencies.\u201d  \n>  \n>Overall, Samsung\u2019s smartphone division appeared to remain resilient amid an overall tough quarter for the industry. Shipments of smartphones fell 13% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, according to data released Thursday by market research firm Canalys. Samsung reclaimed the top spot globally in terms of smartphone market share, Canalys said.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Tech recovery underway?**  \n>  \n>Samsung is the latest tech company globally to report earnings after numbers from U.S. technology giants [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/), [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) and [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/).  \n>  \n>Daniel Yoo, head of global asset allocation at Yuanta Securities Korea, pointed to strong results from these American tech firms.  \n>  \n>Meta saw [first-quarter sales boosted by advertising from Chinese companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/meta-q1-23-earnings-boosted-by-chinese-retailers-buying-ads.html) while Microsoft posted\u00a0[third-quarter results](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2023.html)\u00a0that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.  \n>  \n>\u201cI do think that the recovery story is coming.

It's the day after FOMC and markets are selling off. $MSFT, however, briefly dipped below its June lows and has since recovered, making it one of the few large-cap stocks in the green today. \n\nThat being said, this dip below support could be a deviation before pushing higher or the beginning of much more downside ahead. Regardless, something of interest to note right now is that the number of MSFT social mentions, as tracked by LunarCrush, is showing sustained growth with more and more people creating posts and talking about Microsoft Corp (MSFT) right now at these price levels. I find this interesting because, for the first time since $MSFT's ATH back in Nov 2021, the social activity around $MSFT is trending up again, after months of trending down. \n\nSo according to this data, there is a peak of interest in MSFT right now and it continues to grow. Whether this peak of interest in MSFT is short-sighted or long-sighted is up to interpretation but is interesting nonetheless.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? Is $MSFT's rising social activity a bullish sign? Are people fearful right now? Are they wanting to buy? \n\nLet's discuss!",

Berkshire owns 14.66 million shares valued at $975 million as of the end of 2021, the filing shows.

Activision also said in November that it was delaying the releases of Diablo IV and Overwatch 2.

When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May \u2014 a $2.7 billion \u201cbargain purchase gain\u201d from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase \u2014 earnings were $4.37 per share.\n\nRevenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.\n\nShares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.\n\nJPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it\u2019s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income \u2014 all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March \u2014 the bank has outperformed smaller peers.\n\nThat\u2019s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.\n\nThis time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.\n\nThe acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry\u2019s funding costs to rise.\n\nThat\u2019s pressuring the industry\u2019s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nLenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.\n\nThe bank won\u2019t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.\n\nFinally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.\n\nWells Fargo\nalso reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday. Goldman Sachs discloses results Wednesday.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-earnings-2q-2023.html",

I'm still green on most everything but I've given back a lot of gains, these definitely aren't all my investments but a majority of the bigger positions.    \nTech/Growth:  AAPL, GOOG, PLTR, TSLA, AMZN, AMD, UBER, BABA, JD etc. \\~35%  \nTravel/Rebound (cyclical):  UAL, AAL, OXY, MGM, MAR, NCLH, TRIP, ABNB \\~30%  \nFinancials: WFC, BCS, JPM, BAC\\~10%  \nRetail stocks for stimulus check play:  UAA, NKE, M, LULU, etc.  \\~10%  \nOther positions making up less than 15%   \n\n\nSomehow I've lost about 20% of my portfolio with these names in the last month, it doesn't feel like it but every day it goes down 1 or 2% and that starts to add up.  I know I know, in 5 years who cares but I just wanted to know if other people seem to be in the same boat.  I haven't seen the main indexes see that kind of loss so I'm not getting where it seems to be coming from.  Even today when all looked great in the morning now somehow I'm deep red again (another 2%) despite indexes being mostly stable.",

        "post_text": "Fed - Banks have enough capital to continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%. All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.\n\nResults released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.\n\nTheir projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2013 all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed\u2019s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.\n\nSame goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&T (MTB).\n\n\"Today\u2019s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.\n\n\"At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.\"\n\nResults did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario\u201d was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.\n\nThe bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.\n\nBut the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario,\u201d led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.\n\nGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.\n\nIt also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under \u201cglobal and exploratory market shocks.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.\n\nBanks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.\n\nThese tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.\n\nForcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.\n\nPowell discussed this balance last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a trade-off,\u201d he said. \u201cMore capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability\u2026there is no perfect way to assess that balance.\u201d\n\nBarr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring \"reverse stress testing\" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.\n\n\nThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.\n\nIt was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks\u2019 size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.\n\nDemocrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.\n\nSome in this year's test \u2014 BMO Financial, Citizens, M&T and RBC US Group \u2014 were among the every-other-year banks that weren\u2019t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.\n\nBut the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.\n\nThis year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.\n\nAll 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.\n\n\nThe $541 billion in total projected losses include more $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year\u2019s test.\n\nThe banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).\n\nGoldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).\n\nBanks with large trading operations were also tested against a \"global market shock\" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also added a second \u201cexploratory market shock\u201d to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks.\n\nThe global market shock is characterized by a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tests a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures induced by higher inflation expectations.\n\nThe results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.\n\nThe biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-23-banks-survive-feds-2023-stress-test-203007760.html",

The CEO and his family intend to do so starting in 2024, according to a regulatory filing from JPMorgan Friday that described the sale as being \"for financial diversification and tax-planning purposes.\" A JPMorgan spokesman said Friday that the disclosure does not relate to any near-term succession planning. Dimon, 67 years old, is currently the longest-serving CEO of a major national bank. JPMorgan is the largest lender by assets in the US.\n\n\"Mr. Dimon continues to believe the company\u2019s prospects are very strong and his stake in the company will remain very significant,\" JPMorgan said in the filing. The planned stock sale announced by the bank Friday represents roughly 12% of the holdings belonging to the CEO and his family, excluding uninvested shares and stock appreciation rights. \"I can\u2019t do this forever, I know that,\" Dimon told analysts on May 22. \"But my intensity is the same. I think when I don't have that kind of intensity, I should leave.\" The company released a statement in June saying Dimon had \"no plans to run for office\" and that \"he is very happy in his current role.\"",

Rates cuts and higher inflation = great time for VISA.\nA expansionary monetary policy would increase consumer spending in real terms, and accelarate nominal spending even higher because of inflation. Both of these trends would benefit VISA, since it has great pricing power and charges a fixed percentage on any transaction. VISA has little need for capital, so an increase in nominal spending would boost revenues while inflation is unlikely to affect his costs, thus further expanding it's already incredible margins. I believe the transition away from cash to card would be accelarated, both because of less cash in the wallet and the advantages of financing purchases at lower rates.\nI think visa could return 15% y/y in this situation, with 12 free cash flow growth and FCY of 3%.\nThe only risk I see are slower growth (current PE of 30) and governament regualtions.\n\n2. High rates low inflation = great time for JPM. In this situation JP Morgan chase would probably be able to expand its balance sheet, because of people moving their asset into JPM from smaller and riskier banks, as well as Aquistions of distressed banks very short on liquidity. In addition, the Bank would be able to employ this capital at high rates, and increase its credit spread substantially. All of this should lead to massive profits, putting JPM fortress balance sheet in an enviable position, like we saw in 2022.\nI'm this scenario I think 15% returns are possible ( 6% free cash flow growth and 9% FCY)\nThe main risk I see is a fall in CIB revenues and some losses on the asset side (few distressed loans and marking to market some bonds with high duration)\n\nThe financial sector is historically quite risky, and prudence is key when investing, however I think these companies will do great is some scenario, and good in others, and survive in all but the most tragic ones, thus MAY offer and interesting Risk/Reward proposition.\nWhat are your thoughts of these companies?

For instance, JPMorgan likely benefited from an influx of deposits after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank experienced fatal bank runs.\n\nBut the industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift holdings into higher-yielding instruments like money market funds. That will probably curb banks\u2019 gains from rising interest rates amid the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to tame inflation.\n\nThe flow of deposits through American financial institutions is the top concern of analysts and investors this quarter. That\u2019s because smaller banks faced pressure last month as customers sought the perceived safety of megabanks including JPMorgan and Bank of America. But the bigger picture may be that deposits are leaving the regulated banking system overall as customers realize they can earn higher yields outside checking and saving accounts.\n\nAnother key question will be whether JPMorgan and others are tightening lending standards ahead of an expected U.S. recession, which could constrict economic growth this year by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow money.\n\nBanks have begun setting aside more loan loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy later this year, and that could weigh on results. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.27 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.\n\nWall Street may provide little help this quarter, with investment banking fees likely to remain subdued thanks to the still-shut IPO market. CFO Jeremy Barnum said in February that investment banking revenue was headed for a 20% decline from a year earlier, and that trading was trending \u201ca little bit worse\u201d as well.\n\nFinally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the economy and his expectations for how the regional banking crisis will develop. JPMorgan has played a central role in propping up a client bank, First Republic, which teetered last month, in part by leading efforts to inject it with $30 billion in deposits.\n\nShares of JPMorgan are down about 4% this year, outperforming the 31% decline of the KBW Bank Index.\n\nWells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to release results later Friday, while Goldman Sachs and Bank of America report Tuesday and Morgan Stanley discloses results Wednesday.",

It also provided access to the startup\u2019s founder, [Charlie Javice](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-charlie-javice), who joined the New York-based bank as part of the acquisition.\n\nMonths after the transaction closed, JPMorgan said it learned the truth after sending out marketing emails to a batch of 400,000 Frank customers. About 70% of the emails bounced back, the bank said in a [lawsuit filed last month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/jpmorgan-says-it-was-defrauded-in-175-million-frank-acquisition) in federal court.\n\nJavice, who had approached JPMorgan in mid-2021 about a potential sale, lied to the bank about her startup\u2019s scale, the bank alleged. Specifically, after being pressed for confirmation of Frank\u2019s customer base during the due diligence process, Javice used a data scientist to invent millions of fake accounts, according to JPMorgan.\n\n\u201cTo cash in, Javice decided to lie, including lying about Frank\u2019s success, Frank\u2019s size, and the depth of Frank\u2019s market penetration in order to induce JPMC to purchase Frank for $175 million,\u201d the bank said. \u201cJavice represented in documents placed in the acquisition data room, in pitch materials, and through verbal presentations \\[that\\] more than 4.25 million students had created Frank accounts.\u201d\n\nInstead of gaining a business with 4.25 million students, JPMorgan had one with \u201cfewer than 300,000 customers,\u201d JPMorgan said in the suit.\n\n## Frank emails\n\nIn the suit, JPMorgan alleged that Javice first asked her engineering chief to create \u201cfake customer details\u201d using algorithms. When he refused, she found a data science professor at a New York-area college to create the accounts, the lender said.\n\nThe bank included incriminating emails between the unnamed professor and Javice in its suit.\n\nFor instance, Javice had allegedly asked the professor, \u201cWill the fake emails look real with an eye check or better to use unique ID?\u201d\u00a0\n\nJPMorgan had access to the emails because it had acquired Frank\u2019s technology systems as part of the acquisition, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\n## Javice\u2019s defense\n\nA lawyer for Javice told The Wall Street Journal that JPMorgan had \u201cmanufactured\u201d reasons to fire her late last year to avoid paying millions of dollars owed to her. Javice has sued JPMorgan, saying the bank should front legal bills she incurred during its internal investigations.\n\n\u201cAfter JPM rushed to acquire Charlie\u2019s rocketship business, JPM realized they couldn\u2019t work around existing student privacy laws, committed misconduct and then tried to retrade the deal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro [told the Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-bought-college-financial-aid-platform-for-175-millionand-now-says-most-of-its-users-were-fake-11673470572). \u201cCharlie blew the whistle and then sued.\u201d\n\nSpiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, didn\u2019t immediately return a call from CNBC.\n\nJPMorgan spokesman Pablo Rodriguez had this response:\n\n\u201cOur legal claims against Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar are set out in our complaint, along with the key facts,\u201d he said. \u201cMs. Javice was not and is not a whistleblower. Any dispute will be resolved through the legal process.\u201d\n\n## \u2018Pinch me\u2019\n\nThe alleged fraud perpetrated by Javice and one of her executives \u201cmaterially damaged JPMC in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $175 million,\u201d JPMorgan said in its suit.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of this legal scuffle, this is an embarrassing episode for JPMorgan and its CEO, [Jamie Dimon.](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) In a bid to fend off encroaching competitors, JPMorgan has gone on a [buying spree of fintech companies in recent years](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/jpmorgan-jpm-fintech-deal-to-acquire-renovite-to-battle-stripe-and-block.html), and Dimon has repeatedly defended his technology investments as necessary ones that will yield good returns.\n\nThe fact that a [young founder](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-charlie-javice) in an industry [known for shaky metrics](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/fintech-startups-2022-2023-a-reckoning-is-upon-us-heres-what-to-expect.html) and a \u201cfake it \u2019til you make it\u201d ethos managed to allegedly dupe JPMorgan calls into question how stringent the bank\u2019s due diligence process is.\n\nIn an interview at the time of the deal, Javice marveled at how far she had come in just a few years leading her startup.\n\n\u201cToday is my first day employed by someone else, ever,\u201d Javice told CNBC. \u201cI mean it still feels very much like, pinch me, did this really happen?\u201d\n\nAs a result of the legal scuffle, JPMorgan shut down Frank early Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cFrank is no longer available\u201d the website now reads. \u201cTo file your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), visit StudentAid.gov.\u201d",

The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing has $55 billion. I think Robinhood has, I think, 80, the last time I saw, something like that. We\u2019re not seeing your -- bragging about our product because I would say it\u2019s not good enough yet.

JPM seemed pretty evasive about how much return one could expect from these sky high expenses.\n\n* Why did JPM and Citi not do well but WFC went up.

It appears to be a zero risk with potential reward thing to do, unless the security is a part of some security specific requirement under capital reserves (which I don't think there is).\n\nThey could use that to extend margin to hedgies who are ready to except risk since there are no requirements for them.\n\nAdditionally, JPM and other big banks could also use banks like FRC to funnel their HTM securities to their balance sheets and take interest payments on collateralized debt.\n\nThis is absolutely insane! There is literally no downside for JPM or other banks! If Fed increases the interest rates, they buy more bonds with the money they got with HTM securities. If Fed decreases interest rates, hedgies benefit with the risk assets appreciating and inturn paying JPM a spread over the current interest rate JPM gets from Fed!\n\nCould anyone think of why this is not a zero risk trade for the big banks?

I'm copying/pasting some of the more interesting paragraphs here:\n\n> The full shock of monetary tightening by the Fed has yet to hit. A great edifice of debt faces a refinancing cliff-edge over the next six quarters. Only then will we learn whether the US financial system can safely deflate the excess leverage induced by extreme monetary stimulus during the pandemic.\n\n> A Hoover Institution report by Prof Seru and a group of banking experts calculates that more than 2,315 US banks are currently sitting on assets worth less than their liabilities. The market value of their loan portfolios is $2 trillion lower than the stated book value.\n\n>The White House baulked at a blanket guarantee for all deposits because that would look like social welfare for the rich. Besides, the FDIC has only $127bn of assets (and less very soon) and may ultimately require its own bailout. \n\n>The horrible truth is that the world\u2019s superpower central bank has made such a mess of affairs that it has to pick between two poisons: either it capitulates on inflation; or it lets a banking crisis reach systemic proportions. It has chosen a banking crisis.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n> \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n> \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.\n*****\n> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n> # Jobs report\n> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n> \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n> \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n> \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n> \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n> In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-14-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful?

        "post_text": "$JPM rant. I need a little assurance on my stock purchase. Held for a long time Hi,\n\nI am a novice looking for some assurance regarding my position with JPM holdings.\n\nMy average is about $115 as I have been buying this stock for about 2 years consistently DCAing.\n\nWhy I bought it? It is a well established company with great service and located everywhere. I see them lasting for a long time. But most importantly, the CEO is phenomenal. \n\nOf course, as the market goes, a crash came and their stock is pretty darn below my average. \n\nNatural answer is to buy more. And I likely will to keep up with my fundamentals. However, I have been feeling a lil weak lately. Unlike other companies, JPM is just not recovering. The CEO's heart surgery certainly didn't help and really destroyed the stock then.\n\nRealistically, I know the most logical option is to just hold. Why? For the reasons I stated above and it makes zero sense to buy high and sell low. DCA and move on.\n\nIt just feels crappy after these years of accumulating this stock! I Know I should see this as a buying opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any good hope regarding this stock? Banks are likely suffering the worst right now.",

        "post_text": "[JPM HSBC STAN.L DB BK] Leaked Treasury documents reveal that major banks are knowingly moving money for organized crime without doing anything about it A collection of files from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that is largely composed of so-called \"suspicious activity reports\" covering $2 trillion in transactions from 1999 to 2017 shows that major banks, such as **JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank**, and **Bank of New York Mellon** knowingly move money for **drug cartels**, the **Taliban** and other **organized crime enterprises**.\n\nWhile at least some of these transactions are caught and documented in internal audits, which may then even be reported to the authorities, neither the banks nor the authorities are making much of an effort to put an end to these. The authors of the article suggest that the banks just want to keep the business while officials fear cracking down on the banks as it might set negative precedents that would require them to take legal action against dozens of banks, causing enormous economic damage and political fallout.\n\nWhile this shouldn't be much of a surprise to anyone, it's interesting to see how this system emerged over the past two decades. I also wasn't aware that the authorities were complicit in it to this extent. I suspect that this leak won't have much of an impact, though - neither on the banks, nor on the market. I will definitely keep an eye on some of the big finance symbols on Monday, though.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fincen-files-financial-scandal-criminal-networks](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fincen-files-financial-scandal-criminal-networks)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54226107](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54226107)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinCEN\\_Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinCEN_Files)\n\n[https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/download\\_data\\_fincen\\_files.zip](https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/download_data_fincen_files.zip)",

Here I am, a couple of weeks back and I see PayPal down 50%.\n\nGreat company I say.\n\nGuidance to double revenue by 2025 they say.\n\nHow foolish is the market for punishing this stock so much, I say.\n\nSo, I buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComes out today with a 50% decline in EPS year-over-year, and a 20% drop in EPS guidance for full-year 2022.\n\nFuck you PayPal, you fucking piece of shit company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those of you that think that the price drop after-hours is an \"overreaction\".... Why?\n\nI personally don't sell on rumours or herd mentality, but rather when there is a fundamental change in the company's milestones. Today, PayPal showed that it's failing to deliver. Massively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Having spent quite some time looking into today's Earnings, along with past releases, I'm beginning to think that the EPS decline is not as bad as it seems.\n\nWith any investment, Quarterly updates serve as a benchmark for you to decide whether there's fundamental shifts in the company's execution and/or strategy that could shift the **why** you invested in the first place.\n\nThe reality is that (see the latest Investor Update deck from PayPal's website) [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q4/PYPL-Q4-21-Investor-Update.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/PYPL-Q4-21-Investor-Update.pdf)\n\n(1) TPV and Revenue are (excluding eBay) expected to grow at roughly \\~20% for FY22 (2022: TPV growing to $1.5T and revenue to exceed $29B)\n\n(1i) Revenue growth includes an eBay decline of $600Mil, which is actually very impressive\n\n(2) Free Cashflow is expected to grow by approximately \\~11% for FY22 to $6Bil. This is similar but stronger guidance than the year before.\n\n(3) FY-21 Venmo volume increased 44% to $230Bil\n\n(4) Net income was impacted by:\n\n(4i) Volume-based expenses grew 22.5% and non-transaction related expenses grew 10.4% \u25e6 Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.6% and technology and development increased 19.1%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Verdict**\n\nAfter relevant research, I firmly believe that after a near 50% correction, a further 10-15% drop is indeed an overreaction to this news. There could be some more selling to follow, but I will personally be buying more.\n\nThe latest earnings highlighted some profitability concerns, but PayPal is in no way, shape or form a struggling company.\n\nI am bullish.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.\n*****\n> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.\n*****\n> \u201cMost of the slowdown occurred in March,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cDo we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You\u2019re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n> \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n> \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n> \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,\u201d Krosby said. \u201cThat is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Annual Declines Are Rare\n\n> Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday\u2019s close, the S&P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n> \u201cA positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders\n\n> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$RAD** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$BBBY** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$CBSH** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$AMRN** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$LAKE** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$LOVE** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$KEY** \n> * **$SON** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$BLX** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$MUSA** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$BMI** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$SRC** \n> * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $102.76\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "Fed - Banks have enough capital to continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%. All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.\n\nResults released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.\n\nTheir projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2013 all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed\u2019s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.\n\nSame goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&T (MTB).\n\n\"Today\u2019s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.\n\n\"At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.\"\n\nResults did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario\u201d was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.\n\nThe bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.\n\nBut the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario,\u201d led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.\n\nGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.\n\nIt also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under \u201cglobal and exploratory market shocks.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.\n\nBanks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.\n\nThese tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.\n\nForcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.\n\nPowell discussed this balance last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a trade-off,\u201d he said. \u201cMore capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability\u2026there is no perfect way to assess that balance.\u201d\n\nBarr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring \"reverse stress testing\" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.\n\n\nThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.\n\nIt was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks\u2019 size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.\n\nDemocrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.\n\nSome in this year's test \u2014 BMO Financial, Citizens, M&T and RBC US Group \u2014 were among the every-other-year banks that weren\u2019t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.\n\nBut the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.\n\nThis year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.\n\nAll 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.\n\n\nThe $541 billion in total projected losses include more $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year\u2019s test.\n\nThe banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).\n\nGoldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).\n\nBanks with large trading operations were also tested against a \"global market shock\" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also added a second \u201cexploratory market shock\u201d to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks.\n\nThe global market shock is characterized by a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tests a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures induced by higher inflation expectations.\n\nThe results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.\n\nThe biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-23-banks-survive-feds-2023-stress-test-203007760.html",

        "post_text": "1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left. *Introduction*\n\nI'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.\n\nIn the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.\n\nI maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.\n\nI've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.\n\n*Portfolio distribution*\n\n* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*\n* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*\n* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)\n* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER\n* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**\n\nnote: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*\n\nI sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.\n\nI'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *\"fear of missing out\"* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.\n\n*Income, expenses & conditions*\n\nMy monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.\n\n*The Missing piece*\n\nWhat i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer.",

It appears to be a zero risk with potential reward thing to do, unless the security is a part of some security specific requirement under capital reserves (which I don't think there is).\n\nThey could use that to extend margin to hedgies who are ready to except risk since there are no requirements for them.\n\nAdditionally, JPM and other big banks could also use banks like FRC to funnel their HTM securities to their balance sheets and take interest payments on collateralized debt.\n\nThis is absolutely insane! There is literally no downside for JPM or other banks! If Fed increases the interest rates, they buy more bonds with the money they got with HTM securities. If Fed decreases interest rates, hedgies benefit with the risk assets appreciating and inturn paying JPM a spread over the current interest rate JPM gets from Fed!\n\nCould anyone think of why this is not a zero risk trade for the big banks?

When commercial bank reported profits today, and it seems suddenly there were huge gains in the price of stocks in the first hour of the October 17th session.\n\nI don't understand why people think increased profits from lending is good news.  Of course when the 10 years U.S. treasury is below the 8 or so percent of inflation, you can expect people lending money to make a profit from the high interest rates borrowers are willing to pay.\n\nBut I worry about inflation. When the 10-year U.S. Treasuries are at a lower rate than inflation, you can expect the market to behave a lot like there is still stimulus by low prime interest rates.  I see the higher cost of borrowing as expensive and would reduce future profits companies earn and the higher cost of borrowing would cause consumers to spend less when they can't afford to borrow. This would cause stocks to continue to decline and we still are far from a market bottom.\n\nIf guess if the Fed wants to fight inflation, maybe they could raise the prime rate to 8 percent, equal to the rate of inflation. Having borrowers' attention, then clearly tell people that everyone can help fight inflation by trying to cut spending. Consumers should ask if you really need a new car this year or if you really need an another coat just to keep up with fashion every year. Also business investments can wait until rates and inflation come down. To borrow, build and have an economic slowdown isn't a good idea.\n\nIf you are bottom fishing, looking for bargain stocks at the lowest market low, please watch out that we may still see the price of stocks decline more when persistent stagflation cut into the stock's earnings. I've been looking for dividend as long term income. If you are a short term investor, maybe invest in 90 day T-bills to capture short term rates that sometimes can be closer to the rate of inflation, the the risk of price decline is minimal.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n> \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n> \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.\n*****\n> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n> # Jobs report\n> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n> \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n> \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n> \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n> \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n> In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-14-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful?

Hey guys!!! \n\n\nI've been following BAC for a while now, it's been bullish since Trump took office and I was basically to the point of thinking I missed a 'good' entry. Well! As you all saw, the financial sector took a pretty good hit last week and BAC has gone from ~$25 to $23. \n\n\n\nSans a disaster of some sort, or a failure in tax reform, I see no reason it shouldn't get back to its bullish run again. Compared to most competitors in the same sector, the eps and RSI is better looking and with more Fed hikes in the future they should be making decent gainz. \n\n\n\nSo! Will someone *please* talk me out of this? (even though I've already bought in for ~1k). \n\n\n\nAlso, love em or hate em, I've filled up on some BAC+B's at around 0.92 - just the other week we were at 1.50 so hoping when we normalize those'll go back up \n\n\n\nThanks guy!!!",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.\n*****\n> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.\n*****\n> \u201cMost of the slowdown occurred in March,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cDo we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You\u2019re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n> \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n> \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n> \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,\u201d Krosby said. \u201cThat is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Annual Declines Are Rare\n\n> Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday\u2019s close, the S&P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n> \u201cA positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders\n\n> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$RAD** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$BBBY** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$CBSH** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$AMRN** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$LAKE** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$LOVE** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$KEY** \n> * **$SON** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$BLX** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$MUSA** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$BMI** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$SRC** \n> * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $102.76\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 21, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 21, 2021**\n\n***Please Note:*** *Hello friends! If you were wondering where the Daily Market has been the last two weeks, I have had a great few months in the market and decided, now that I am fully vaccinated and the US is reopening, to go on vacation to New York (I live in California). I am now back home and ready to get back to the regular schedule! The Recap will be posted every day again from now on.*\n\nStocks jumped today, with the three major indexes rising, looking to recover the losses after the volatility experienced last week after the Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook was announced. If anything, last week\u2019s volatility shows us that the game of tug-of-war between inflationary pressures spooking investors and the Federal Reserve reiterating it will maintain accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future continues. As I have said in the past, while I acknowledge the risk posed by the elevated inflation readings, I too believe any pressure is transitory and remain extremely bullish moving forward. \n\nThe Federal Reserve in the United States has a dual mandate: maintaining inflation stable and maximum employment. In light of the pandemic and surge in unemployment following lockdown, its maximum employment mandate has broadened. The measures and tools for achieving these mandates differ and have also changed recently. On the upside, the Fed now has additional flexibility in providing and maintaining accommodative monetary policies, namely near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, to support the economy. The downside is that as the economy continues to improve, policies may stay loose for too long, leading to inflation and forcing the Fed to respond by aggressively raising interest rates, which would pretty much tank equities. In my view, this is the fundamental risk hanging over the market moving forward: Is the Fed misinterpreting inflationary readings as transitory? In my view, they are not. \n\nLast week, the spotlight was squarely on the Federal Reserve meeting, with market participants anxious to see how the Fed interprets and plans to react to the higher-than-expected inflationary readings. Analysts broadly expected the Fed to discuss a timeline for tapering its asset purchase program and a potential timeline for interest rate hikes. Instead, the Fed made no mention of a taper timeline and signaled they anticipate the first interest rate hike to occur in 2023. Overall, the report was very positive for equities, which is why the SPY so quickly recovered after an initial dump on Wednesday. \n\nIn my opinion,  it seems the Fed\u2019s decision to leave out a \u201ctaper timeline\u201d in the latest meeting reinforces the view consistently reiterated by the members of the Fed that current inflationary readings are \u201ctransitory\u201d (meaning not permanent) and largely reflects factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, such as global supply chain disruptions, materials shortages, and labor market imbalances. Moreover, I suspect Jerome Powell wants to avoid another \u201cTaper Tantrum\u201d like the one in 2013 and intends to be as clear as possible about the Fed\u2019s expectations in order to avoid mixed messages (Read more about the 2013 Taper Tantrum [here,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp) but basically markets freaked out after the Fed announced it was tapering quantitative easing passed during the 2008 recession since the economy had largely recovered by that point). In the end, the market kept going unabated, something I find very likely to happen again when the Fed inevitably announces they are tapering. In the end, I expect taper talks to begin towards the end of this year, but the lack of its mention in this Fed outlook meeting is an encouraging sign the Fed is not concerned about the elevated inflation readings. \n\nMoreover, the median projection among Fed officials is now for two rate hikes in 2023 despite the Fed raising inflation expectation for 2021, another sign the central bank remains unconcerned with the current levels of inflation. While the 2023 timeline is sooner than originally predicted, the two year timeline signals that the Fed will continue to move slowly and deliberately when considering any policy adjustment. \n\nLater this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amblin Partners, a movie studio headed by famed director Steven Spielberg, announced a partnership with Netflix (NFLX) to produce future films.  \n* Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany's antitrust watchdog on Monday after the cartel office said it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a note Monday that households were the largest source of equity demand in the first quarter of 2021 after generating net purchases of $172 billion. \u201cWe estimate that households currently allocate 44% of their assets to equities, slightly below the all-time high allocation of 46% in 2000. But high cash balances and continued retail participation in equity markets should bolster household equity demand.\" \n* EU antitrust regulators will decide by July 26 whether to clear a $30 billion bid by AerCap (AER) to buy the aircraft leasing business of General Electric (GE).\n* Bank of America (BAC) said oil may surge to $100 a barrel by next year as travel demand rebounds. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Ameriprise Financial (AMP) target raised by Citigroup from $265 to $290 at Buy.

I\u2019m not worried about BAC or JPM but their dividends suck compared smaller regional banks, there\u2019s a reason for that I\u2019m sure, but regional banks have dropped considerably more than the big guys, and so I see a much greater upside to the small regional banks. I\u2019m no Michael Burry, but what would an all clear look like?\n\nEdit: I guess at what point in time are small regional banks in the clear. Is it a wait and see? If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a 100% gamble on some of these smaller banks, they may go under, may not, and these massive drops and increases happen within a day or two which makes it impossible for retail to respond in a timely manner. I suppose that\u2019s what it is, I\u2019ll simply have to take a chance. And why are all these bank earnings at the same time holy cow, they\u2019re all in July. That puts retail at a disadvantage having all the same earnings dates.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n> But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n> \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n> \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n> \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n> \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n> \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n> \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # News High for Net New Highs\n\n> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Breadth Booming\n\n> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n> October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # JPMorgan Chase & Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.

As such, the rebuilding of $1T data center infrastructure that's currently installed will drive growth over the next 10 years, bringing material performance improvement and cost savings\n\n  \n2) ROI: Jensen reiterates that while using a GPU to augment a CPU will drive an increase in cost in nominal terms (roughly 2x), in the case of Spark (a distributed processing system and analytics engine for big data), the net cost benefit could be as large as 10x as the application will be sped up 20x.\n\n  \nFrom a top line generation, he shares that hyperscale customers can generate $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on NVDA GPUs, given sustained strength in the demand for accelerated computing.\n\n  \n3) With respect to Nvidia's moat, Jensen highlights that the large install base of NVDA GPUs across multiple platforms, ability to augment their hardware with their proprietary software, and ability to build rack-level systems and innovate across various chips creates an insurmountable moat.\n\n  \n4) Jensen once again compliments his supply chain partners, highlighting TSMC for being the reason for NVDA's exponential revenue growth in 2H23/2024. That being said, he did note that NVDA has adequate in-house IP to shift manufacturing without material disruption if needed. He also stressed that companies are relentlessly demanding new chips so they can be first, to the point where tensions are rising as they demand their chips now.\n\n  \n5) The most important part: Jensen reiterated that the company will begin shipping Blackwell chips in 4Q25 and that shipments will scale in FY26 (Note that NVDA is currently in 3Q25 for their accounting calendar). Demand for Blackwell is incredibly strong and he feels that NVDA has a personal responsibility to ensure all companies are able to obtain the supplies needed to develop AI",

At the time, I presumed these wealth managers, after managing hundreds of millions - if not billions - of other people\u2019s money for decades, would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success. Surely, they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities, technical indicators, news events, macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack. I was dead wrong.\n\nWhat I discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things. In fact, there was very little effort that went into managing OPM (other people\u2019s money), and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that their strategies were bad or didn\u2019t work. I am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive. In short, anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save 1% of their money a year in perpetuity. Without further ado, here\u2019s what I learned:\n\n**Goldman Sachs**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are various divisions within GS wealth management that handle money differently. I break it down into low net worth, mid-net worth, and high net worth offerings. The low net worth folks are given Marcus, an automated investment system that simply relies on ETFs paired with some basic bond funds. It\u2019s the same as buying Vanguard Target Retirement funds.\n\nThe mid-net worth offering is where I spent the bulk of time understanding. They find 30 stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the S&P 500. As the SPX is largely tech, they are overweight technology. Basically, they take the SPY and cut it down from 500 companies to 30 companies.\n\nWhy would they offer a less diverse array of stocks?\n\nThey state as the reason that they are better able to manage 30 investments than 500, and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index - their words - they\u2019d rather find stocks with lower beta (volatility) and thus likely lower returns.\n\nThey locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the S&P 500 once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments. They target a 6% annual return after accounting for their 1% fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them.  This amounts to $10,000 per year for a $1M portfolio for many years - a lot of money to part with.\n\nDid I mention, you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them, unless you happen to already own one of the 30 stocks they pick? So there are tax consequences of getting involved.\n\nFor the HNW folks, the above offering is available and they offer additional products, such as the ability to invest in private equity, REITs and hedge funds. As you might imagine, the more money they manage, the more \u201cfree\u201d accounting services they include.\n\n**Personal Capital**\n\nThis may actually be my favorite, given the simplicity of it. They take the main sector ETFs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money, to recreate their own ETFs by sector. They charge you a fee to use their ETFs.\n\nThey start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector ETF, but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before. They do this annually. They do nothing all year.\n\nThey charge a fee for managing your money. I recall it being 25 or 35 basis points, but you have to also pay to use their ETFs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a Vanguard S&P 500  fund or a group of the sector ETFs calling it quits.\n\n**Ritholtz Wealth Management**\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched CNBC regularly, you\u2019d recognize the commentator Josh Brown - a partner of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He\u2019s the one with the thick New York City accent. When I found out I may have the chance to have his insights managing my money, I was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable. But the wealth management shop was not impressive.\n\nIn fact, their model was exactly the same as that of Goldman Sachs: they pick about 30 stocks, stick your money in them, rotate them every quarter, and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick. They target 5-6% annually, net of fees. Yes, you heard that correctly, 5-6%.\n\nThe next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories: SPY collars, ETF aggregators, or tactical investors\n\n**SPY Collars**\n\nThis strategy involved putting all of your money into the SPY ETF then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time. They take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the SPY for similar expiration dates. This strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside. For those who are not used to options, here\u2019s how it works.\n\nLet\u2019s say the SPY is trading at $400. You own it. You sell someone else the right to buy it from you for $440 for $40 per call. So long as the SPY stays under 440, the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium. If the SPY goes above 440, you have to either sell your shares at $440 (plus pocket the $40 per call option premium, making this a sale at 480) or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for. You\u2019d lose money on the call, but the SPY shares have gained in value, so you still come out ahead. You are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the SPY all the way to $490. This creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment.\n\nThe option puts work the other way, protecting your investment on the way down. Since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts, you haven\u2019t spent any new money but have bought yourself insurance. If the SPY drops, the value of your put option (a short on your own investment) increases. This increase offsets your losses, protecting you, especially in the case of extreme correction.\n\nIf the SPY rises, you lose the value of your put, so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow this, don\u2019t worry, the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so, they also prevent you from having any major gains. You are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns. Over time, you will not beat the S&P 500 index with this strategy and they say this.\n\nSo there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while. It\u2019s mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money.\n\n**ETF and Mutual Fund Aggregators**\n\nAbout 7 firms I interviewed used this strategy. I heard the same thing so often, I thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me. Essentially, they just bought all sector ETFs or a basket of mutual funds for you. A few of the firms would use the collars I spoke of above if the market got a little choppy, but most did not.\n\nThis strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops - under $250M AUM - which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money. The bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly.\n\nI could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself. I have vodka for that, so this strategy was not for me.\n\n**Tactical Firms**\n\nThese firms were harder to find and their DNA was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality. They invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value, growth, and good dividends. They chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip.\n\nOne thing I did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting - a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others.\n\nThe best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value. Imagine holding Apple stock and selling a call on it. If Apple goes up, you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss. If you do the latter, in year 1 and sell a second option in year 2 at the same price or more than the call you bought back, you can write off the loss in year 1 while avoiding actual losses.\n\nYou can roll calls like this forever, amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity. It was a nice trick I\u2019ve used many times now, especially when I want to sell something I\u2019ve held for years with significant gains.\n\nTheir desire to protect the portfolio, I felt, prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market. In 2019, when I spoke to them, they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to 60% cash in their portfolio. I never reached back out to see how they did, but I suspect they were buying the dips in March 2020.\n\nTheir overall returns were around 10% but not as good as simply buying the SPY and holding. But they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events.\n\n**In the end, I never hired any of them.** I decided instead to use what I learned and what I knew and manage my own money. In case you read this far and are curious, yes, my returns have beaten all these firms\u2019 average returns and I\u2019ve actually learned a lot in the process. Sharing in case anyone could use the strategies.",

        "post_text": "DD: Cloudflare (NET) is going to continue its strong outperformance. Buy the dip Alright guys. This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**---**\n\n**What is Cloudflare?**\n\nCloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:\n\n>\u201cImagine you\u2019re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  \n>  \n>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...\u00a0\u00a0you\u2019re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter\u201d\n\nSeriously, this is cool, and it\u2019s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what\u2019s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Over the coming months, we\u2019ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It\u2019ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we\u2019ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won\u2019t just be your frontend, it\u2019ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.\n\nSoon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare\u2019s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they\u2019ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a developer, you probably didn\u2019t understand most of that, but essentially, they\u2019re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.\n\nI can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it\u2019s profitability... \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n(And even if it doesn\u2019t, and stays at 50%, it will still \ud83d\ude80 but slower. Regardless, it\u2019s going up)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n\u201cBuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs\u201d\n\nThat drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren\u2019t long. Plus it\u2019s hardly a tank when it\u2019s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher\n\nIts earnings was good, and to those who haven\u2019t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock\u2019s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:\n\n>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRevenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn\u2019t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that\u2019s $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year\n\nYes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That\u2019s why I\u2019m long Jan 21 115c.\n\nThe revenue and growth isn\u2019t the impressive part. The margins are\n\n>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nHigh 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they\u2019re going to be **raking** in dough\n\nThat being said, NET isn\u2019t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they\u2019ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn\u2019t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early \u201822\n\n\\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare\u2019s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.\n\n\\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014-\n\n**CONS**\n\nThe only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I\u2019m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there\u2019s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don\u2019t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare\u2019s \u201cBuild a Better Internet\u201d shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare\u2019s already enormous Cloudflare network.\n\nThis stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren\u2019t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I\u2019m trying to be conservative here).\n\nSeriously, give this a second look. I\u2019ve been playing NET since 37. It\u2019s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn\u2019t done its 30% move. I\u2019m completely assured that it will soon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Made a huge mistake in the first iteration. I implied Cloudflare makes only 130 million a year. They made that last quarter. Their 2020 revenue was almost half a billion ($431 million)",

        "post_text": "Fed - Banks have enough capital to continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%. All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.\n\nResults released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.\n\nTheir projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2013 all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed\u2019s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.\n\nSame goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&T (MTB).\n\n\"Today\u2019s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.\n\n\"At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.\"\n\nResults did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario\u201d was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.\n\nThe bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.\n\nBut the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario,\u201d led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.\n\nGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.\n\nIt also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under \u201cglobal and exploratory market shocks.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.\n\nBanks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.\n\nThese tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.\n\nForcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.\n\nPowell discussed this balance last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a trade-off,\u201d he said. \u201cMore capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability\u2026there is no perfect way to assess that balance.\u201d\n\nBarr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring \"reverse stress testing\" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.\n\n\nThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.\n\nIt was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks\u2019 size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.\n\nDemocrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.\n\nSome in this year's test \u2014 BMO Financial, Citizens, M&T and RBC US Group \u2014 were among the every-other-year banks that weren\u2019t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.\n\nBut the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.\n\nThis year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.\n\nAll 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.\n\n\nThe $541 billion in total projected losses include more $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year\u2019s test.\n\nThe banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).\n\nGoldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).\n\nBanks with large trading operations were also tested against a \"global market shock\" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also added a second \u201cexploratory market shock\u201d to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks.\n\nThe global market shock is characterized by a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tests a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures induced by higher inflation expectations.\n\nThe results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.\n\nThe biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-23-banks-survive-feds-2023-stress-test-203007760.html",

As someone who is incredibly OCD, one thing I\u2019ve always been a big fan of is simplicity. \n\nWhen I first signed up for Goldman Sachs \u201cMarcus\u201d app, I was impressed with the simplicity. The app is fast and sleek yet has all necessary bells and whistles. Something very \u201ceasy to use half asleep at 2 am\u201d. You can send a one click wire. There\u2019s a tracker that shows progress for any bonuses you\u2019re eligible for. Their investment in simplicity compared to other, complicated apps made me move all of my savings to them, and I\u2019d probably move my checking to them too when they launch that. \n\nI was recently surprised to find this again in a second company - Square\u2019s cash app. The second I opened it for the first time, I likened it to a \u201cfisher price app\u201d - super simple to use, super simple to understand, clean interface - yet powerful.\n\nI unfortunately can\u2019t find a link to an article I read recently, but it showed that people are experiencing app overload and prefer 8-10 apps ... no more. I believe this trend towards simplicity will continue and would like to factor it into my investment decisions moving forward (for my \u201cplay\u201d account). \n\nCurious on other companies &amp; industries providing high levels of abstraction/simplicity around what they do best. Is Lemonade ($LMND) an example? I haven\u2019t had an opportunity to use their product.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.\n*****\n> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.\n*****\n> \u201cMost of the slowdown occurred in March,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cDo we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You\u2019re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n> \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n> \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n> \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,\u201d Krosby said. \u201cThat is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Annual Declines Are Rare\n\n> Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday\u2019s close, the S&P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n> \u201cA positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders\n\n> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$RAD** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$BBBY** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$CBSH** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$AMRN** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$LAKE** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$LOVE** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$KEY** \n> * **$SON** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$BLX** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$MUSA** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$BMI** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$SRC** \n> * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $102.76\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "A Look at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) #**Introduction**\n\nThe market crash caused by COVID-19 allowed investors many opportunities to buy strong companies at low valuations. The S&P 500 has now rallied almost 60% since the March bottom and value has become significantly harder to find in a market where high valuations are king. Retail investors have turned to struggling companies in the airlines, cruise lines, and hospitality industries. Many of these companies have a very real bankruptcy risk and are not good candidates for value investing.\n\nHowever, there are still strong companies that are fundamentally undervalued due to the Pandemic, primarily in the financials sector. One such company is [Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS)]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/GS).\n\n#**Description**\n\nGoldman Sachs is an investment banking firm in the capital markets industry. The Company\u2019s trading business accounts for approximately [60% of revenue]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-results/trading-becomes-a-plus-for-goldman-once-again-during-coronavirus-rout-idUSKCN21X1M1), making the company less susceptible to decreased revenues from low-interest rates. The Company also is involved in consumer banking and asset management. Goldman plans to further expand into these two categories, [especially digital consumer banking]( https://fintechranking.com/2020/07/23/inside-goldmans-product-roadmap-for-digital-bank-marcus/). \nGoldman\u2019s most obvious competitor is Morgan Stanley, who [recently acquired E*TRADE]( https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-closes-acquisition-of-e-trade).\n\n#**Valuation**\n\nTicker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|Fwd P/E|PEG|P/B|Div\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\nGS|Goldman Sachs|68.41B|10.97|8.22|1.27|0.89|2.53%\nMS|Morgan Stanley|93.02B|8.68|10.09|2.34|1.01|2.72%\n\nGoldman Sachs shows clear potential as a value play with a P/B under 1. Its PEG of 1.27 shows future earnings expectations are reasonably priced, compared with the sector average of 2.32. Goldman\u2019s trailing P/E comes in at 10.97, with a sector average of 18.22. \n\nGoldman pays a sustainable dividend of 2.53% with a payout ratio of 27.70%. The dividend yield follows the sector average of 2.21%. \n\nThe average price target for Goldman is $255, with a current price of $202. Analysts are expecting upside of over 25%. These metrics indicate Goldman is a strong value buy.\n\nValuation data sourced from [Vhinny](https://www.vhinny.com/) and [Finviz](https://finviz.com/).\n\n#**Outlook**\n\nGoldman recently beat third-quarter estimates, with $9.68 EPS instead of the predicted $5.57. The beat was primarily due to gains in their bond trading and asset management businesses. The trading division of Goldman Sachs saw a 29% increase in revenue from the same quarter last year.\n\nThis strong earnings beat shows that Goldman is less impacted by low interest rates when compared with primarily consumer banks. Goldman Sachs can focus on its core businesses of trading and investment banking operations, without losses in consumer and business loans having a significant impact on revenue.\n\nFurthermore, Goldman has recently started to expand its FinTech presence with Marcus. Through Marcus, Goldman provides [high-yield online savings accounts, personal loans, and financing through MarcusPay]( https://www.marcus.com/us/en). Goldman\u2019s entry into the space will likely serve as a positive catalyst for future growth.\n\n---\nDisclosure: I am long $GS with shares.",

I am now back home and ready to get back to the regular schedule! The Recap will be posted every day again from now on.*\n\nStocks jumped today, with the three major indexes rising, looking to recover the losses after the volatility experienced last week after the Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook was announced. If anything, last week\u2019s volatility shows us that the game of tug-of-war between inflationary pressures spooking investors and the Federal Reserve reiterating it will maintain accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future continues. As I have said in the past, while I acknowledge the risk posed by the elevated inflation readings, I too believe any pressure is transitory and remain extremely bullish moving forward. \n\nThe Federal Reserve in the United States has a dual mandate: maintaining inflation stable and maximum employment. In light of the pandemic and surge in unemployment following lockdown, its maximum employment mandate has broadened. The measures and tools for achieving these mandates differ and have also changed recently. On the upside, the Fed now has additional flexibility in providing and maintaining accommodative monetary policies, namely near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, to support the economy. The downside is that as the economy continues to improve, policies may stay loose for too long, leading to inflation and forcing the Fed to respond by aggressively raising interest rates, which would pretty much tank equities. In my view, this is the fundamental risk hanging over the market moving forward: Is the Fed misinterpreting inflationary readings as transitory? In my view, they are not. \n\nLast week, the spotlight was squarely on the Federal Reserve meeting, with market participants anxious to see how the Fed interprets and plans to react to the higher-than-expected inflationary readings. Analysts broadly expected the Fed to discuss a timeline for tapering its asset purchase program and a potential timeline for interest rate hikes. Instead, the Fed made no mention of a taper timeline and signaled they anticipate the first interest rate hike to occur in 2023. Overall, the report was very positive for equities, which is why the SPY so quickly recovered after an initial dump on Wednesday. \n\nIn my opinion,  it seems the Fed\u2019s decision to leave out a \u201ctaper timeline\u201d in the latest meeting reinforces the view consistently reiterated by the members of the Fed that current inflationary readings are \u201ctransitory\u201d (meaning not permanent) and largely reflects factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, such as global supply chain disruptions, materials shortages, and labor market imbalances. Moreover, I suspect Jerome Powell wants to avoid another \u201cTaper Tantrum\u201d like the one in 2013 and intends to be as clear as possible about the Fed\u2019s expectations in order to avoid mixed messages (Read more about the 2013 Taper Tantrum [here,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp) but basically markets freaked out after the Fed announced it was tapering quantitative easing passed during the 2008 recession since the economy had largely recovered by that point). In the end, the market kept going unabated, something I find very likely to happen again when the Fed inevitably announces they are tapering. In the end, I expect taper talks to begin towards the end of this year, but the lack of its mention in this Fed outlook meeting is an encouraging sign the Fed is not concerned about the elevated inflation readings. \n\nMoreover, the median projection among Fed officials is now for two rate hikes in 2023 despite the Fed raising inflation expectation for 2021, another sign the central bank remains unconcerned with the current levels of inflation. While the 2023 timeline is sooner than originally predicted, the two year timeline signals that the Fed will continue to move slowly and deliberately when considering any policy adjustment. \n\nLater this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amblin Partners, a movie studio headed by famed director Steven Spielberg, announced a partnership with Netflix (NFLX) to produce future films.  \n* Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany's antitrust watchdog on Monday after the cartel office said it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a note Monday that households were the largest source of equity demand in the first quarter of 2021 after generating net purchases of $172 billion. \u201cWe estimate that households currently allocate 44% of their assets to equities, slightly below the all-time high allocation of 46% in 2000. But high cash balances and continued retail participation in equity markets should bolster household equity demand.\" \n* EU antitrust regulators will decide by July 26 whether to clear a $30 billion bid by AerCap (AER) to buy the aircraft leasing business of General Electric (GE).\n* Bank of America (BAC) said oil may surge to $100 a barrel by next year as travel demand rebounds. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Ameriprise Financial (AMP) target raised by Citigroup from $265 to $290 at Buy.

With some FUD in the market right now due to a combination of Omicron, inflation concerns, overvaluation, tapering, etc., are there any stocks you\u2019re just waiting to fall so you can swoop in and buy them at a cheaper (and possibly fairer) price? I know I have a few\u2026\n\n1) ADBE: My lone non-purchase regret from when I started in April. I didn\u2019t know at the time just how big of a moat the company had, and when I found out, it was already in the 600s. Had a chance to buy during the September-October sell-off, but set my price level too low (wanted in under 500, but it never dipped under 550). If this thing dips back into the 500s, I\u2019m entering and DCAing down.\n\n2) HD/LOW: Didn\u2019t buy when I started because I saw the big climb on their charts, but these two chains basically have home improvement by the balls. Plus, they pay some handsome dividends. Ideally, I\u2019d love for HD to come back to 300, but that won\u2019t likely happen barring something catastrophic, so maybe the 350s is where I start building a position.\n\n3) GS: I panic sold this one during the last deep correction when I found out it had exposure to Evergrande, and while it was a profitable sell, it\u2019s since leaped back into the 400s. Likely won\u2019t get my original entry price of the 340s, but deep enough pullback will get my attention.\n\n4) ABBV: Had this ticker and panic sold it when it crashed hard that one morning back in September. Only made a few dollars when I was up over $100 at one point. It then started another slow run upward. If it comes back to my original price of 107, I\u2019m re-entering.\n\nYours?",

Economists at Barclays BARC, -3.69% and Jefferies backed up the shifting expectations, by indicating they expect policy makers to deliver a hike of that magnitude at their June 14-15 meeting.\n\nBeneath the issue of where the Fed goes from here is a much more fundamental and serious problem: Some observers fear the U.S. central bank has already effectively lost control of inflation. May\u2019s price gains were broad-based \u2014 hitting everything from shelter to gasoline and food, as well as the narrower gauge, the so-called core reading, that excludes food and energy. The data were \u201ccatastrophically bad\u201d for both the Fed and Americans, said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nashville-based Laffer Tengler Investments, which oversees $1.1 billion.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw in this report which was disappointing and a little alarming is that the core reading, excluding food and energy, came in hotter than expected and that\u2019s after we dropped off from a very high number for April 2021,\u201d she said via phone. \u201cThis is a much more persistent and stickier kind of inflation that takes years to work through the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fed has been wrong at every single turn and we should be seeing a 75 basis point hike at the June meeting,\u201d Tengler said. \u201cThe question is whether they can surprise and I don\u2019t think we are going to see that. Every time they delay, that allows inflation to run rampant and this raises the odds of recession.\u201d Equity markets will be \u201cugly and choppy through summer because inflation numbers are not going to improve.\u201d\n\nIndeed, traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings have expected a string of annual headline CPI readings that rises to as high as 8.8% in August and September, before settling to 8% for October. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to a record low this month.\n\nSeptember outlook\n\n\u201cAll in all, the report should be of great concern for the Fed given that price gains in both the headline and the core measures show no signs of abating, and we expect prices to continue to register firm gains in the near term,\u201d TD Securities strategists Oscar Munoz, Priya Misra and others wrote in a note. \u201cWe expect the Fed to maintain its aggressive tightening bias in the months ahead, look for the Committee to hike rates by 50bp both next week and in the July FOMC meeting, and believe a 50bp hike in September may not be out of the question.\u201d\n\nA team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -5.65%, led by Jan Hatzius, agreed with TD\u2019s September assessment, by saying \u201cwe now expect the Fed to hike the funds rate by 50 bps in September (vs. +25bp previously), in addition to +50bp moves in June and in July.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report should extinguish any pretense that a \u2018pause\u2019 in rate hikes will likely be appropriate by the end of summer, as the Fed is clearly still behind the eight ball on bringing inflation under control,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.\n\n\u201cInvestors should expect the Federal Reserve to continue on its 50-bp rate hike path next week and beyond until inflation shows meaningful signs of decelerating toward the Fed\u2019s 2-3% target range,\u201d Pride said.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s CPI report was a doozy,\u201d said Tom Graff, head of investments at Facet Wealth.\n\n\u201cWhile we knew the headline number would probably come in high due to food and energy prices, consensus was that the month-over-month Core CPI would slow sequentially,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cUnfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. Headline CPI came in a full 1% for the month and a 40-year high 8.6% for the year, and core stayed steady at +0.6% for the month and 6.0% for the year.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe most concerning part of this report was its breadth. The monthly number wasn\u2019t driven by a few items. Most of the major categories actually accelerated price increases month-over-month. Most observers agree that broader inflation is more likely to persist.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s inflation data suggests the \u2018peak inflation\u2019 debate may be premature,\u201d said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management. \u201cThe idea of peak inflation assumes that our supply chain disruptions are over and won\u2019t recur anytime soon and I\u2019m not so sure we can be confident of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors remain too confident that the Federal Reserve will be able to control inflation,\u201d Davis said by email. \u201cWe should not take the Fed\u2019s ability to control inflation as a given.\u201d",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n> But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n> \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n> \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n> \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n> \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n> \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n> \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # News High for Net New Highs\n\n> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Breadth Booming\n\n> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n> October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # JPMorgan Chase & Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 14, 2020. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 14, 2020**\n\nStocks accelerated yesterday\u2019s losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.\n\nToday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be \u201cdifficult\u201d before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson called \u201cproductive\u201d. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. \n\nThe impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said \u201cWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.\u201d The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting \u201cGo big or go home!!!\u201d for more stimulus. \n\nIn other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\nIn terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that \u201cJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans \u2014 $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) reported third-quarter results that greatly exceeded expectations.

Intel is finally catching up with Moore's Law Moore's Law states the amount of transistors on a chip doubles every two years but the cost of production drops by half. This concept was created by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel and has actually held up for decades.\n\nASML designs and manufactures EUV lithography machines, which are extremely high precision machines that put complex designs on incredibly small chips. ASML is the only EUV lithography design and manufacturer in the world. Look up their stock performance and financials if you question these claims.\n\nIntel used to be a top class chip manufacturer but they've struggled with the 7nm chips and their stock has been punished. The simple reason for Intel's shortcomings is they've not been using EUV lithography machines from ASML.\n\nPlain and simple, without EUV lithography, Intel has been handicapping itself for years now and is a big reason they have fallen behind. The last link below notes how their 7nm chip design is now using EUV lithography at the 2 new fab plants they are building for $20B in Arizona. Intel is going to start to catch up.\n\nTLDR: ASML provides the technology to keep Moore's Law alive and Intel hasn't been using it until now. Their depressed, low P/E stock valuation will begin to correct with outperformance as their technology begins to catch-up after major mistakes not using EUV lithography.\n\n[ASML Keeping Moore's Law Alive](https://www.wired.com/story/asml-extreme-ultraviolet-lithography-chips-moores-law/)\n\n[ASML is the Key to Intel's Resurrection Just like TSMC beat Intel](https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/semiconductor-advisors/302806-asml-is-the-key-to-intels-resurrection-just-like-asml-helped-tsmc-beat-intel/)\n\n[Intel 7nm Chip Design to Now Use EUV Lithography](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html#gs.h19m75)",

        "post_text": "Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box This is a crosspost from r/wallstreetbets but thought you guys might like it too. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it  would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.\n\nI can't post images here so you can go to the wsb post or the link at the bottom to see images. Disclosure, am long $PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Palantir  Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and  powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients\n* PLTR  has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government,  particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military\n* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients\n* With   \\~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future   opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a   binary outcome to us. Will they or won\u2019t they bring more customers on  to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company\u2019s outlook,  and  as a result, valuation, significantly\n\n**Company Background and Summary:**  Palantir\u2019s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its \u201cfull  stack\u201d approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**   controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a   partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,   existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a   one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which   will be key in its growth as a company.\n\nPLTR\u2019s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.\n\n**Gotham:**  Palantir\u2019s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives  in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify  patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute  responses.\n\n**Foundry:**  This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their  data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large  datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily  targeted to commercial customers.\n\nDespite  having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer  and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach  they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC)  has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019.  The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of  revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR\u2019s ability to  prove  and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR   platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,   integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,   enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \\~AI\\~ among others.\n\nThe  revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year  2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this   revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**   \u2013 mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131   at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and   operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual   for a company in high growth mode.\n\n**Palantir\u2019s Business Model:**  PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement  from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long,  with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running.  Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the  project. PLTR\u2019s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and  Scale.\n\nAcquire  \u2013 PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little  to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing  ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire  phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in   revenue in a calendar year.\n\nExpand  \u2013 This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in  revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those  generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having  negative contribution margin throughout the same period.\n\nScale  \u2013 With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company\u2019s  ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy.  Palantir\u2019s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and  configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use  on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.\n\n**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:**  Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up  analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and  government sectors.\n\nCompany  management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial  customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial  companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying  $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies  PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.\n\nFor  government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their  assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US  and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT  spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has  penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market.\n\nSell-side  estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down   methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to   Palantir\u2019s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM   levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% \u2013 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.\n\n**Government services:**  Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the  results of a recent lawsuit \u2013  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against  the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available  products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In  1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in  FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as  the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large  customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its  attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is  unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US  government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into  commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme  for future  cross-selling opportunities.\n\nGovernment  contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at  least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has  indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts  totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the  funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little  certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent  potential upside to our estimates.\n\n**Commercial services:**  In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform \u2013 a centralized data  OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to  manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the  commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and  leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.\n\nWith  ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful  opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales  cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR\u2019s  complexity,  but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can  grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and  becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its  customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater   than 20% of total commercial revenue.\n\nWhile  the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over  the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in  growth software \u2013 131 (including government entities). Today,  product  market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off  situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated  around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial  services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial  segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a  few contracts per quarter and year.\n\n**Quarterly Earnings recap:**  Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public  company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as  revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most  impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019.  Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter.\n\nThe  company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the  full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of  app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market   fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these   solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers   in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a   not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a   customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be   crucial in diversifying the customer base.\n\nAdjusted  operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a  year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater  efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to  generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force  and account management teams.\n\n**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:**  Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates.  Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a  premium.\n\nThis was post-IPO and no longer relevant\n\nFor  core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth  estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range  of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently  trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables  market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake).  Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV /  Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant  premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the  total of both trading multiples.\n\nHowever, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR\u2019s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.\n\nThese  two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue   visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does   the stock deserve its premium?\n\n**Valuation:**  We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this  company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF  multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in  2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e  FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.\n\nWe lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:\n\n* Number of **net** customer adds \u2013 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025\n* Avg.   Revenue per Customer growth \u2013 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.   From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e\n* Gross Margin % \u2013 a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter\n* Opex Margin % \u2013 a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter\n* Capital Expenditures \u2013 continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex\n* Free   Cash Flow Multiple \u2013 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth   software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS   multiples\n\nFor  purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid  of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As  you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from   customers has a very large effect on the calculation.\n\nThen,  depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on   different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range   of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the  FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an  equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \\~$3 to the  stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin  similarly adds  \\~$3.\n\n**Key Risks:**  Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one  of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a  massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary  opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this  company\u2019s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within  large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high  costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter\u2019s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.**\n\nCustomer  concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made  some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the  largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the  first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.\n\nCompetition  is significant. PLTR\u2019s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it  at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some  organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and  would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools  from other software companies outside of PLTR.\n\nRecent  and near-term expected hiring doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in   significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20   and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing   this decline.\n\nPalantir  is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now  hitting it\u2019s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the  company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash  flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the  company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical   quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more   information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of   the business appropriately.\n\n**Key catalysts:**\n\nIncreased  commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is  able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow  solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the  addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In   addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability   than we have currently modeled.\n\nThe  company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous  delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the  main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by  Apollo and more \u2018productized\u2019 offering have  resulted a lowered average  implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.\n\n**TLDR;**  Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play.  Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of  company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with  its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read  and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.\n\nIf you want to play with the model, I tried to keep it as simple as possible you can download it here at the bottom of the page for free: \n\n[https://millennialmkts.com/2020/11/22/palantir-valuation-opening-the-black-box/](https://millennialmkts.com/2020/11/22/palantir-valuation-opening-the-black-box/)",

        "post_text": "What Is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Mystery Stock? Big Investment by Warren Buffett Could Be Disclosed Tomorrow. What is the Berkshire Hathaway \ufffc mystery stock?\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate could reveal that equity holding when it discloses its stock investments as of Dec. 31, 2020 on a securities filing expected late Tuesday.\n\nSpeculation is that it could be Walt Disney \ufffc (ticker: DIS), PayPal Holdings \ufffc (PYPL), Google parent Alphabet \ufffc (GOOGL), Home Depot \ufffc (HD), Exxon Mobil \ufffc (XOM), or Chevron \ufffc (CVX).\n\nWhen it released its most recent quarterly filing in mid-November for about $250 billion of equity holdings, Berkshire (BRK.B) said that it had made a confidential filing for unnamed investments, stating \u201cConfidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d\n\nBerkshire CEO Buffett has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 \ufffc (PSX).\n\nThe SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.\n\nThe mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nGary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.\n\nBlack has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company\u2019s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.\n\nIn recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire\u2019s holding in Goldman Sachs Group \ufffc (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase \ufffc (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo \ufffc (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie \ufffc (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb \ufffc (BMY).\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nI think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd. But recent years his 2 managers will most likely pick techs, then googl and some other tech stocks will become target. Disney will be also favorable since it is the best recovery play stock with huge grow opportunity with streaming. What do you guys think.\n\nThanks for the awards.",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.\n\nLast week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as \u201ctransitory\u201d and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.\n* \u201cMeme stocks\u201d continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!\n* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84\n* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $522 at Buy. Stock currently around $412\n* UPS target raised by Citigroup from $220 to $235 at Neutral. Stock currently around $215\n* The Gap (GPS) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $38 at Hold. Stock currently around $33.4\n\n\u201cSomeone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a **tree** a long time ago.\u201d - Warren Buffet",

        "post_text": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

        "post_text": "JPMorgan president says a recession may be price to pay to beat inflation, market bottom not in yet  \n\n[JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) President [Daniel Pinto](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/our-leadership/daniel-pinto) has vivid memories of what life is like when a country loses control of inflation.\n\nAs a child growing up in Argentina, Pinto, 59, said that inflation was often so high, prices for food and other goods spiked on an hourly basis. Workers could lose 20% of their salary if they didn't rush to convert their paycheck into U.S. dollars, he said.\n\n\"Supermarkets had these armies of people using machines to relabel products, sometimes 10 to 15 times a day,\" Pinto said. \"At the end of the day, they had to remove all the labels and start over again the next day.\"\n\nThe experiences of Pinto, a Wall Street veteran who runs the [world's biggest investment bank](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2022/3rd-quarter/c363d5ac-0a3e-483e-88ec-89767a8e266e.pdf) by revenue, informs his views at a key time for markets and the economy.\n\nAfter unleashing trillions of dollars in support of households and businesses in 2020, the Federal Reserve is grappling with inflation at four-decade highs by raising rates and pulling back on its debt-buying programs. The moves have cratered stocks and bonds this year and rippled around the world as a surging dollar complicates other nations' own battles with inflation.\n\nLiving with pervasive inflation was \"very, very stressful\" and is especially hard on low-income families, Pinto said in a recent interview from JPMorgan's New York headquarters. Price increases averaged more than [300% a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina#cite_note-ucematgu-80) in Argentina from 1975 to 1991.\n\n## Aggressive Fed\n\nWhile there is a growing chorus of voices who say that the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases amid some signs of price moderation, Pinto is not in that camp.\n\n\"That's why when people say, \\`the Fed is too hawkish,' I disagree,\" said Pinto, who became JPMorgan's sole president and chief operating officer earlier this year, solidifying his status as CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/)'s top lieutenant and potential successor.\n\n\"I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,\" he said. \"If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay.\"\n\nThe Fed can't allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, according to the executive. A premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the 70s and 80s, he said.\n\nThat's why he thinks it's more likely the Fed errs on the side of being aggressive on rates. The Fed funds rate will probably peak at around 5%; that, along with a rise in unemployment, will likely curb inflation, Pinto said. The rate is currently in a 3% to 3.25% range.\n\n## Markets haven't bottomed\n\nLike a [string of other executives](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-warns-its-time-to-batten-down-the-hatches.html) have said recently, including Dimon and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) CEO D[avid Solomon](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/goldman-ceo-david-solomon-says-theres-a-good-chance-of-a-recession-and-so-its-time-to-be-cautious.html), the U.S. faces a recession because of the Fed's predicament, Pinto said. The only question is how severe the slowdown will be. That, of course, is being reflected in the markets that Pinto watches daily.",

In researching, I found out it was still undervalued, and man, has it shown. Even when it tumbled, it hasn\u2019t been a nightmarish fall. 6.5% growth already.\n\n2) AbbVie (ABBV) - I knew nothing about this company and spent three days researching it before I bought its stock, and it\u2019s been one of the best purchased ever. It doesn\u2019t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%). It\u2019s grown 8.35% in almost four weeks.\n\n1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - First stock I ever bought. Outstanding, steady growth. Hardly has a down day. 10.8% growth in over a month.

        "post_text": "The Secular Small Cap Cycle: A Primer *Warning: I'm a chart guy. This post has a lot of charts, and its follow-up is in danger of containing even more. Proceed at your own risk.*\n\nSince November the last 7 months have been defined by market cap concentration around a select few winners. The Magnificent 7, the somewhat flippant successor to the \u201cFAANG\u201d moniker and similarly composed of big tech representatives, have dragged the S&P and NASDAQ to repeated all-time highs. Behind a torrent of speculative investment on how far they\u2019ll change our lives with artificial intelligence, killer earnings reports, and safe harbor fears, the Mag 7 have become the fat kid sitting on the other end of the see saw. As of May 31, this group makes up 49.8% of the NASDAQ\u2019s market cap and around 31% of the S&P\u2019s. From December 2022 to December 2023, they\u2019ve made up 71% of the latter index\u2019s return; the other 493 companies have a total of 6% versus the S&P\u2019s 19%. Their performance [since the COVID epidemic is even more staggering](https://imgur.com/U4VPyGt).\n\nKeen students of history know this is neither new nor surprising. The NASDAQ, and particularly big tech companies, have been the best performers in the U.S. stock market for the last 25 years. Concentration has been [a hallmark of the S&P 500 stretching back to the index\u2019s birth](https://paulsenperspectives.substack.com/p/what-does-large-cap-concentration). Just like the early 1980s and the turn of the century, an elite group is sucking all the oxygen out of the room while other sectors languish. And just like those periods their reign of dominance will end, leaving the individual members of the Mag 7 either obsolete or a big fish in an ocean with rapidly growing predators infringing onto their territory.\n\nBut that\u2019s easy to claim. The market cap explosion among that group started around 2018 and has been going on for 6 years. Who\u2019s to say it couldn\u2019t continue indefinitely? When Apple can create an entire ecosystem that locks in their customers, when Amazon can create their own marketplace and curtail any threats within it, why can\u2019t they become permanently entrenched? There have been upheavals in all aspects of the economy since 2000, from the proliferation of computers large and small to the way transnational finance have become seamless via electronic coordination. Under these assumptions, there\u2019s no reason not to invest your hard-earned money into guaranteed success.\n\nHowever, I believe there\u2019s the potential for regime change on the horizon. I\u2019m not talking about a swift quietus taking out the current tech giants, but a slow process of re-normalization to an era before ZIRP and QE set the groundwork for tech to comprehensively outpace the rest of the market. It can be summed up in 4 charts.\n\n[Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth](https://imgur.com/FMCog44)\n\n[S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite versus S&P Small Cap 600, Russell 2000, and MSCI Emerging Markets (October 2002 to November 2007)](https://imgur.com/a/wvhX6Iw)\n\n[MSCI Hong Kong (a proxy for HSI, which doesn't show up on Y Charts for whatever reason) versus S&P Small Cap 600](https://imgur.com/AQ1LMZn)\n\n[Gold Versus Effective Federal Funds Rate, 2000-2024](https://imgur.com/ux5zNeg)\n\nThis will be a 2-part article. Part 1 is dedicated to explaining what the Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth is, and how its twists and turns are an excellent predictor for the fortunes off the small-cap sector. Part 2 will explore why Chinese indexes have such strong correlation with the S&P 600 and how the very end of the gold vs FFR chart signals a sea change in the commodity landscape.\n\n**Oh No, Another Obscure Fed Chart...**\n\nThe FCI-G was a new Fed index that debuted on June 15, 2023, and it was deliberately created to address some nagging discrepancies their analysts had with other measures of the macroeconomic landscape.\n\n[The Fed - A New Index to Measure U.S. Financial Conditions (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/a-new-index-to-measure-us-financial-conditions-20230630.html)\n\nTo briefly summarize, they found indices like the NFCI or the Bloomberg FCI were often too abstract with the implications of their statistical models or too opaque with regards with how they weighed their variables. The models didn\u2019t translate their findings into straightforward commentary on economic activity or the state of the economy. A secondary issue was how macro models treated economic indicators from a *sub specie aeternitatis* perspective, failing to note that changes in policy and other variables had dispersed impact over time. So they created a new index, which collects seven different components to create a simple representation of how favorable economic conditions are in the United States. Anything above 0 represents a tightening of conditions, and below 0 a loosening: positive values reflect headwinds to GDP growth and negative values imply tailwinds. The 3-year lookback contributes the delayed effects of earlier changes in the model's variables onto the 1-year lookback. The seven components are:\n\n* Federal Funds Rate\n* 10-Year Treasury Yield\n* 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate\n* BBB-Rated Corporate Bonds Yield\n* Dow Jones Stock Market Total Return Index (this is not the DJI, this is the DWCF)\n* Zillow Home Price Index\n* Nominal Broad Dollar Index\n\nFor me the technical logic behind the weighing process is fascinating, but tedious for an investor. What matters for you is what it predicts and corroborates with.\n\n**Richard Driehaus' Playhouse**\n\nSince 1990 the FCI-G has had a positive value peak that strongly reversed into negative territory in 4 instances: January 1995, September 2002, February 2009, and February 2016^1. Three of these points came at the end of a recession or crash, paralleling enormous bull runs out of small caps. Depending on which index you select, emerging markets also enjoyed the same radical trajectory. These are the rare instances where small caps/emerging markets outstrip the general indices by significant margins, and their effective timespans vary by quite a bit.\n\nLet\u2019s compare the relative performance indices during those runs. Here are the troughs and peaks of the Hang Seng (HSI), S&P Small Cap 600 (SML), Russell 2000 (RUT), and MSCI Emerging Markets (MSEM) before they consolidated or declined for a three-month period. We will place them alongside the S&P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) to see if and by how much they outperformed/underperformed the big boys. Due to the frequent lack of synchronicity between the various indexes, I\u2019ve included two different time spans for the S&P and NASDAQ: one specifically contemporaneous to the Hang Seng\u2019s trajectory, the other for the small cap and EM indices.\n\nNote the MSEM\u2019s results should be taken with a large grain of salt. Its composition has changed greatly through time, and the influence of the 7-year cycle on its returns is contingent on geographical exposure. ASEAN made up the vast majority of the EM Asia section before 1995, and the 1997 Asian financial crisis saw a drastic rebalancing in favor of South Korea and Taiwan. Since 2000 it has gained more and more exposure to China, making the overall index more sensitive to swings in the Chinese economy. Between 1991 and today, Latin America\u2019s representation has shrunken from 50% to barely under 10% - the MSEM doesn't reflect its up-and-downs.\n\nAdditionally, HSI doesn't show up on YCharts searches. I used SeekingAlpha for its growth values and dates.\n\n[**First FCI-G Plateau and Drop (January 1995) - Alan Greenspan...increased rates?**](https://imgur.com/TOWztKa)\n\n|**Index**| **Time Period** | **Increase**|\n|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| HSI | 1/9/1995 \u2013 7/27/1997 | 7252.34 \u2192 16379.22 (126%) |\n| SML | 12/12/1994 \u2013 5/4/1998 | 88.14 \u2192 203.09 (130%) |\n| RUT | 12/09/1994 \u2013 4/20/1998 | 235.71 \u2192 490.27 (108%) |\n| MSEM | No correlation | No correlation |\n| SPX | 12/08/1994 \u2013 7/27/1997 | 445.45 \u2192 936.45 (110%) |\n|-------| 12/08/1994 \u2013 4/14/1998 | 45.45 \u2192 1115.75 (150%) |\n| IXIC | 12/09/1994 \u2013 7/27/1997 | 719.05 \u2192 1563.53 (117%) |\n|------| 12/09/1994 \u2013 4/22/1998 | 719.05 \u2192 1917.61 (167%) |\n\nIt would be remiss to not point out the Hang Seng\u2019s rise was smothered by the Asian financial crisis.

Then the former got trounced by all of them, with tech trailing a bit behind RUT and SML. The end of the Great Financial Crisis saw amazing returns out of the first 3 although the NASDAQ bested every index except SML (barely). Similarly, IXIC went neck-to-neck with the smaller groups after the 2015-2016 Chinese crash leaked into other markets creating a chain reaction.\n\n**Unlike Todd Howard's Games, It Just Works**\n\nAt the end of October 2023, the FCI-G indicator peaked, dropped, and has continued to drop until a slight uptick in April. This is reflected in several of the FCI-G's components.\n\n* [The 10-year yield](https://imgur.com/OKAgU0g) broke 5% back on October 19 before wobbling around 4.86-4.89 for the next ten days. On October 31 it stumbled down the stairs to end up at 3.8% before New Year\u2019s. Since then, it\u2019s climbed back to 4.55%, threatening to break out above 4.70% in mid-April. In perfect synchronicity, [the BBB corporate effective yield](https://imgur.com/OKAgU0g) went from 6.66% to 5.24% in the same period before retracing the 10-year\u2019s path higher. Ditto for the [30-year fixed mortgage](https://imgur.com/iADC76Z).  \n* One day later, [the dollar index](https://imgur.com/mGl9YQ7) hit 107 before beginning its slow decline down to 101 by December 27th.\n\nThe catalyst for these downturns was the Fed meeting on November 1, where it was agreed that interest rates needed to stay at 5.25-5.50% for the foreseeable future. Interestingly, in a textbook case of emergent sentiment the market didn't take Powell and co. at their word. They fervently began to price in \\*rate cuts\\*, as many as 6 in 2024, and maintained that rosy outlook until roughly April. As deluded as those expectations might've been, they presaged the decline of all four indicators - three related to the cost of capital, one to the cost of living.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen from the smaller indices matches well with history. Since early 2021, [the Russell 2000 had been locked in a consolidation phase that\u2019s left it lagging far behind SPX and NASDAQ](https://imgur.com/X3RYLwg). The end of the 2002 everything bubble shifted it into a lower level where it continued to move sideways. It futilely banged its head against the 2050 resistance line 3 times before shoving past it at the end of October (not a coincidence). Furthermore, RUT\u2019s support levels have currently stabilized above the 50 and 200 SMA \u2013 it has significant momentum. The index is now seeking to breach the next resistance level of 2130, its old peak from March 30, 2022.\n\nAnd guess what? [The S&P Small Cap 600 had imitated the exact small cycle and broke out on the same day](https://imgur.com/WJJzdRL). Even the MSEM, as mercurial and underwhelming its reaction has been in the last two cycles, has [mutedly followed suit](https://imgur.com/oHRgUi4).\n\nHopefully I've convinced you that the FCI-G is a meaningful predictor and harbinger of changes in the market. It has unerringly signaled both the base price movement and long-term trajectory of small-cap and EM indices for almost 30 years, and we should expect great returns within these sectors over the next 3-5 years. Yet I'd further argue this is understating the nature of the tailwinds propelling these less-favored stocks. Several macroeconomic trends are lining up to hint that this iteration won't be like 2009, 2016, or 1995. If anything, expect the future to look more like 2002. Why? I'll dive more deeply into the plumbing, so to speak, of the world economy and how the 2010s were a historical outlier in Part 2. In addition, I'll give recommended sector-based actions^2. \n\n^1 COVID was an exogenous event that forced quantitative easing, while the other four were driven by economic trends with some outside impact. \n\n^2 I'm not going to give out names/tickers for any individual stocks that aren't already listed in my portfolio. The reason is simple: the information I've presented is easy to obtain, but doing research to ferret out the companies with maximum potential upside and least market attention is time intensive. People pay me to do this for them. Why should I screw them over by giving it away for free?",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 17th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 17th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are ignoring the lack of a stimulus package from Congress, but that could change  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/stocks-are-ignoring-the-lack-of-a-stimulus-package-from-congress-but-that-could-change.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.\n*****\n> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 flirted with record levels it set in February.\n*****\n> In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.\n*****\n> Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July\u2019s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\n*****\n> \u201cThe juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks \u2026 we\u2019ve seen this sideways [market] action,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cIt feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.\u201d\n*****\n> Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.\n*****\n> Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.\n*****\n> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.\n*****\n> \u201cI think it will cross over a line where they care,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.\u201d Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.\n*****\n> \u201cWhat they\u2019re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the binary outcome of whether there\u2019s a deal or no deal. There\u2019s going to be less air going into the balloon.\u201d\n*****\n> # It\u2019s the economy\n> Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.\n*****\n> Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.\n*****\n> President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.\n*****\n> \u201cI think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there\u2019s not more help here,\u201d said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we\u2019re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.\u201d\n*****\n> Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.\n*****\n> \u201cWe need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,\u201d he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.\n*****\n> He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.\n*****\n> The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.\n*****\n> \u201cThe multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don\u2019t provide it, it\u2019s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that\u2019s going to show up in all the data in October,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThey are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0VN7xgL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CqxPmuk.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/pw7FpMd.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jz178H45/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaRJleM.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YQIFlRp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O9Ufbwy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ceoh8Vj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/PJY8b32m/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/zXNCDPYY/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/DzhkxTtY/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/W1gcm3fk/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 4 Charts That Will Amaze You\n\n> The S&P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.\n\n> From the lows on March 23, the S&P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It\u2019s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming. We absolutely saw that back in March and now with stocks near new highs, many have missed this record run. Here we show how stocks have been usually higher a year or two after corrections.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> After a historic drop in March, the S&P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GS-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cIt normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. \u201cThen again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn\u2019t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n> # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch\n\n> US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**\n\n> Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-TLT.png))**\n\n> The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Retail Sales Rock to New Highs\n\n> At the headline level, July\u2019s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn\u2019t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June\u2019s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.\n\n> Besides the fact that this month\u2019s report was better underneath the surface and June\u2019s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-retail-sales-chart1.png))**\n\n> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just released B.I.G. Tips report we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # 100 Days of Gains\n\n> Today marked 100 trading days since the Nasdaq 100's March 20th COVID Crash closing low. Below is a chart showing the rolling 100-trading day percentage change of the Nasdaq 100 since 1985. The 59.8% gain over the last 100 trading days ranks as the 3rd strongest run on record. The only two stronger 100-day rallies ended in January 1999 and March 2000.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/ndx100use.png))**\n\n> While the Nasdaq 100 bottomed on Friday, March 20th, the S&P 500 bottomed the following Monday (3/23). This means tomorrow will mark 100 trading days since the S&P 500's COVID Crash closing low. Right now the rolling 100-day percentage change for the S&P 500 sits at +46.7%. But if the S&P manages to trade at current levels tomorrow, the 100-day gain will jump above 50%. It has been 87 years (1933) since we've seen a 100-day gain of more than 50%!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/spxrolling0812.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # B.I.G. Tips - New Highs In Sight\n\n> Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.\n\n> While the S&P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/Streaks-Chart.png))**\n\n> Whenever the S&P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **NOTABLE TICKERS REMOVED DUE TO R/STOCKS AUTO MOD** \n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/PJY8b32m/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/MThQQ2b6/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 8.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ILeuUCn.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 8.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sR89byw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 8.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzJCGGO.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 8.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0gUoYvK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 8.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V2jCvoz.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 8.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gpfSG2w.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 8.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0TZ1FzI.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 8.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2K0BoN.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 8.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/armLGC0.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 8.21.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n> # Walmart Inc. $132.60\n> **Walmart Inc.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Oct 15, 2020. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 15, 2020**\n\nStocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. \n\nThe Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week\u2019s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAfter Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.\n\nMarket participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180 degree turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that \u201cgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details\u201d. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, \u201cI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.\u201d Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.\n* US jobless claims reached 898,000 which was higher than the estimates of 830,000.\n* Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) has cut power to around 33,000 customers to mitigate risk of starting a wildfire citing dry and windy conditions renew threat of fires.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) had a price increase by Deutsche Bank from $27 to $38 at BUY. Big increase in analyst sentiment, the stock trended upward today.\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raise from Mizuho from $116 to $125 at BUY. It opened low, but recovered throughout the day. Stock has been a monster lately. \n* Dell (DELL) had a price target raised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) from $70 to $80 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) had price targets raised by Citigroup (C), and Barclays from $285 to $300 at BUY, and $253 to $270 at EQUAL WEIGHT, respectively. Stock faded towards the end of the day, nevertheless bullish analyst actions.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $240 to $255 at BUY.

This thing is squeezing, up 60% in the last two days!\n* Take-Two (TTWO) had a price Target raise by Morgan Stanley from $176 to $185 at OVERWEIGHT\n* United Health (UNH) had a price target raise from Piper Sandler, Raymond James, SVB Leerink, Oppenheimer and Royal Bank of Canada. On average its a $380 price target at OUTPERFORM, this has been a monster stock!\n* Zoom Video Communications (ZM) had myriad of price target increases, including from Wells Fargo (WFC), Royal Bank of Canada, Piper Sandler, $375 to $465 EQUAL WEIGHT, $450 to $600 OUTPERFORM, and $411 to $501 NEUTRAL. Very bullish analyst action.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) reported better-than-expected results in Q3 earnings. Stock was 1.26% up at the time of writing\n   * EPS of $1.59 vs $1.28 estimate \n   * Revenue of $11.6 billion vs $10.61 estimate\n* Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported slightly better-than-expected earnings. Stock outperformed the market, up 3.96% at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.51 vs $0.47 estimate\n   * Revenue of $2.45 billion v $2.43 billion estimate\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported much better-than-expected earnings, especially in EPS. Stock was 0.9% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.98 vs $0.92 estimate (wow!!!)\n   * Revenue of $12.4 billion vs $11 billion\nEdit: figures on TSM are now correct\n\n\u201cLife is not about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself\u201d -George Bernard Shaw",

Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.\n\nFor example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup\u2019s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short,\u00a0[according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf)\u00a0to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.\n\n\u201cAn assessment of the covered company\u2019s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm\u2019s capabilities have material limitations,\u201d regulators\u00a0[said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf)\u00a0of Citigroup.\n\nThe living wills are a key regulatory exercise mandated in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Every other year, the largest US. banks must submit their plans to credibly unwind themselves in the event of catastrophe. Banks with weaknesses have to address them in the next wave of living will submissions due in 2025.\n\nWhile JPMorgan, Goldman and Bank of America\u2019s plans were each deemed to have a \u201cshortcoming\u201d by both regulators, Citigroup was considered to have a more serious \u201cdeficiency\u201d by the FDIC, meaning that the plan wouldn\u2019t allow for an orderly resolution under U.S. bankruptcy code.\n\nSince the Fed didn\u2019t concur with the FDIC on its assessment of Citigroup, it was overall deemed to have the less-serious \u201cshortcoming\u201d grade.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators,\u201d New York-based Citigroup said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we\u2019ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,\u201d the bank said. \u201cMore broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.\u201d",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 13, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, which generated $80 million* in theater sales and $60 million* in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday\u2019s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to last year\u2019s attack\u201d and that the company was still \u201cunaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers\u201d. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

Another crazy day in the market **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 24, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today, with the market rising throughout the session before nose-diving in the last hour. The benchmarks are now firmly in correction territory, roughly 10% below their record highs at the beginning of the month, erasing the gains from a historic August. Traders are digesting a range of concerns, including uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election, signs of slowdowns in economic growth, dimming hopes for more fiscal stimulus, and worsening trends in Covid-19 cases, particularly in Europe.\n\nAfter rising in the morning, the major indices cut their gains in the final hour of trading. The S&P finished 0.24% up, the Dow finished 0.17% up, and the Nasdaq finished 0.47% up.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claim report, which showed that another 870,000 individuals filed new unemployment claims. This is slightly above Wall Street\u2019s estimates but below the 1,000,000 level that\u2019s become a key marker to measure the health of the pandemic-stricken job market. This data shows that jobs are not coming back at the rate that Wall Street would like and that workers are continuing to struggle to secure jobs in our healing economy. \n\nChris Rupkey, chief economist for MUFG Union Bank said, \u201cThe labor market losses are stunning in that they show there isn't enough work out there yet in the middle of September nine months after the Covid-19 virus shut the economy down. The stock market is falling again over the concerns for the economy as well they should because the high-level of joblessness shows that the country isn't out of the woods yet and it won't be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn't heard by Federal government officials down in Washington.\u201d \n\nUnfortunately, hopes for more stimulus are looking increasingly unlikely before the November election Congressional lawmakers are at an impasse over how much fiscal stimulus should be passed and to whom it should be directed. And more recently with the tragic passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Congress\u2019 focus is now on the Supreme Court.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Boeing shares underperformed the market, ending the day 3.42% down. \n* After beating earnings and gapping up around 10%, Nike (NKE) gave back some gains today. Stock finished 1.83% down today.\n* US new-home sales unexpectedly rose for a fourth consecutive month in August, according to the Commerce Department, with the housing market continuing to make outsized gains relative to the rest of the economy as mortgage rates hold near record lows.\n* CarMax (KMX) announced better than expected earnings. However, investors were not impressed, the stock finished the day 10.96% down.\n   * EPS of $1.79 vs \\`$0.95 estimated\n   * Revenue of $5.37B vs $5.08B expected.\n* Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares are trading higher after Morgan Stanley (MS) upgraded stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight.

Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed\u2019s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation.

It broke past resistance at 371 last week and hasn\u2019t slowed down since, doubling its gains along the way. Plus, the climb has been steady and gradual, meaning it\u2019s reducing my concern of a catastrophic fall.\n\nAlso have to give special props to EBAY for digging itself out of a -40 hole in early-mid May to return to double-digit positive gains again. You go, EBAY!",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Oct 1. Please enjoy!  **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 25, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**\n\n***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*\n\n*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are \"accurate\" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** \n\n*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*\n\n***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***\n\nStocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThe core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting \u201cbase effects\u201d as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.\n\nIn other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. \n* Panasonic, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company\u2019s latest regulatory filing. \n* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, \u201cthere is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $330 at Buy. Stock currently around $292\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Bank of America from $178 to $200 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Carnival Cruises[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCL&src=cashtag_click)(CCL) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $37 to $39 at Buy.

Please enjoy!  **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 25, 2020**\n\nStocks were higher today, with the major benchmarks finishing the day an average of 1.5% up. This unexpected rally comes amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe and concerns that more fiscal stimulus will not be passed.\n\nThe SPY finished \n\nAfter a steady decline from summer peaks through the beginning of September, new COVID-19 cases appear to be on the rise again in the United States. According to data from the *New York Times*, there have been 41,822 new cases per day in the country over the past week, a 14% increase from the previous 2 weeks. Among the states seeing the largest increases in new cases over the past 14 days are Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\n\nIn recent weeks, Europe has struggled to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, with many countries reporting a record number of infections. In France 16,069 new case of Covid-19 were reported, a record for the country. The U.K., which recently announced plans to lockdown once again, reported a record 6,634. These numbers are worse than in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. In response to the increasingly precarious situation, European leaders decried the failure of countries to work together to collectively defeat the virus and told the U.N. General Assembly today that \\`\\`the time has come for countries to reinvent international cooperation.\u201d Throughout the pandemic, European nations have fought internally about access to equipment and vaccines, erected barriers among neighbors to keep out virus infections, and struggled to agree on collective solutions to fight COVID.\n\nToday\u2019s rally in the stock market reflects the heightened volatility equities have experienced this month, as concerns over the presidential elections, a surge in coronavirus cases, the slowing pace of economic recovery, and the lack of fiscal stimulus pile up. House Democrats are reportedly working on a $2.4 trillion stimulus plan, which would be down from the more than $3 trillion they originally pursued, but a sum still well above the closer to $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans had suggested they might accept. \n\nFor their part, monetary officials like Powell and Mnuchin have urged time and again for Congress to pass additional fiscal relief, though the window of opportunity continues to shrink as the November election looms. Eric Rosengren, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance that while the central bank could increase asset purchases to try and support the economy, he was not sure it would be \u201cnearly as supportive, for example, as fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the myriad concerns manifested themselves in a surge in volatility this month, with stocks changing direction from one day to the next and even intraday. Matt Orton, Director and Portfolio Manager at Carillon Tower Advisers said, \u201cWe\u2019ve shot up really, really far. We\u2019ve just \\[gone\\] through a little bit of a corrective process, taking out some of the froth from the really high-flying performers in the information technology space. And right now with an absence of many catalysts as we head into earnings season, we\u2019re likely going to continue to move sideways.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Costco (COST) shares opened lower Friday despite reporting better-than-expected.

Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 30, 2021**\n\nUnfortunately, after a brief bounce in the market yesterday, volatility resumed as market participants continue to contemplate the potential impact of the new coronavirus \u2018Omicron\u2019 variant and new comments by newly re-elected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. \n\n**Some Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.87%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%\n* Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%\n* SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%\n* VIX: +15.51%\n* AAPL: +3.24%\n\nJ. Pow\u2019s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word \u201ctransitory\u201d to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, \u201c\u201cWe tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won\u2019t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it\u2019s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.\u201d\n\nOriginally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the \u201crisk of higher inflation has increased,\u201d but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central bank\u2019s 2% target over the course of 2022.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a \u201cmaterial drop\u201d in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. \n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no world, I think, where \\[the effectiveness\\] is the same level\u2009we had with \\[the\\] Delta \\[variant\\]. I think it\u2019s going to be a material drop. I just don\u2019t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I\u2019ve talked to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. are like, \u2018This is not going to be good\u2019.\u201d\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.\n\nVivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, \u201cInformation is coming rapidly, it's evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors \\[last week\\] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It's all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we've seen. And it seems most likely at this moment \u2014 notwithstanding more information to come\u2014 that it looks like a delay.\u201d I agree, it\u2019s important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) introduced two new custom designed computer chips aimed at competing with data center chips from Intel (INTC), NVIDIA (NVDA), and AMD. \n* Goldman Sachs (GS) unveils new Amazon-backed cloud trading service for Wall Street firms.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases)\n\nMoreover, the White House will deploy 1,000 military personnel to assist at hospitals as capacity starts filling up.   The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant that emerged earlier this year, according to that same Reuters tally.\n\n[https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/united-states/](https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/united-states/)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is in charge of approving and regulating new medications, is expected to authorize the Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) coronavirus treatment pills this week.\n\nLast week, Pfizer reported that its COVID pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/)\n\nMeera Pandit, global market strategist at JP Morgan, said \u201cOn the virus side, ultimately what we\u2019ve seen with prior surges and prior variants is that market sell-offs tend to be somewhat contained to a period of time, so we do expect that as we get better and better at dealing with some of these challenges from the economic and market perspective, things will likely settle down despite some of the public health challenges we have ahead.\u201d\n\nIn other news, market participants are also processing an unexpected blow to Biden's economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) quashed the administration\u2019s long-deliberated Build Back Better Act, citing concerns about inflation, the national debt and ongoing pandemic.\n\nLooking ahead, there is tons of important economic coming out:\n\n* Wednesday - The Conference Board is set to release its latest consumer confidence index, expected to show an only modest uptick for the month of December.\n* Thursday - Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed\u2019s preferred measurement for inflation. Consensus data compiled by Bloomberg showed PCE is projected to climb at a 0.6% month-over-month rate in November.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* President Joe Biden in remarks Tuesday afternoon said he was considering a reversal of recent travel restrictions in light of Omicron\n* AT&T Inc said on Tuesday it was selling its advertising unit, Xandr, to Microsoft. Xandr was created in 2018 through the acquisition of an ad exchange and a TV ad tech company to use data collected from phone, internet and TV services to target consumers.\n* Following the blocking infrastructure bill, Goldmans Sachs (GS) and Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody\u2019s, cut US GDP forecasts for 2022.\n* Moody\u2019s, one of the main credit ratings agencies in the US, once again gave Apple the highest \u2018AAA\u2019 credit\n* The EU approved Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) $16 billion acquisition of Nuance, an AI-powered text to speech company\n* Workers at a Starbucks (SBUX) store in Seattle, the coffee giant\u2019s hometown, say they aim to unionize, adding momentum to the organizing efforts at the chain.\n* Global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity shattered all-time records in 2021,  $5 trillion for the first time ever, with volumes rising 63% to $5.63 trillion by Dec. 16, according to Dealogic data, easily surpassing the pre-financial-crisis record of $4.42 trillion in 2007.\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd has received approval from Taiwan's investment commission to set up a chip manufacturing plant in Japan.\n* Alphabet Inc's YouTube began restoring access to Walt Disney Co channels on its platform on Sunday, after the companies reached a distribution agreement to end a two-day blackout.",

A sudden jump in interest rates and worries about the impact of tariffs and trade disputes on earnings drove stocks lower, with some of the worst losses in growth stocks.\n*****\n> The S&P ended the week on a high note, up 1.4 percent on Friday but closing at 2,767, one point above its 200-day moving average. The moving average is a momentum measure, and it is widely watched, even beyond stock market chartists.\n*****\n> \"The S&P 500 closed right on the 200-day. It's just like a magnet. Everyone looks at these levels as super important, and that's where it ended up,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. \"We enter next week on tenterhooks. There's a whole lot of nervousness. ... Sitting on support, rather than sitting on resistance, is always a better way to enter the earnings season.\"\n*****\n> Companies reporting in the week ahead include Bank of America on Monday; Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson and Johnsonand IBM on Tuesday; Abbott Labs on Wednesday; American Expresson Thursday and Procter and Gamble on Friday.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/earnings-could-be-what-turns-the-tide-for-stocks.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fXOqYcR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Qx2i5Ck.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L78K86C.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B2dRVr8.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/93DjpEj.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s31Dv3R.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U65gwB2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RkpDTN9.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Je4dMwM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/CLVFdZA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/G2md73l.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Bulls Smile After Midterm Elections\n\n> Volatility is heating up in October, with some big drops for stocks late last week. Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

When interest rates fall, a currency tends to depreciate, because investors seek higher yields elsewhere.\n\nA weaker dollar boosts companies' revenues when they export goods and services. That could help to prop up stock market earnings next year, according to Detrick.\n\n\"40% of revenues come from overseas for the S&P 500, so a weaker dollar like we're anticipating could be a little bit of a tailwind for earnings actually coming in better than people think,\" he said.\n\nWall Street's top banks aren't so bullish on stock market earnings.\n\nBank of America and Morgan Stanley both said at the start of December that they're expecting companies to downgrade their targets as the threat of a recession leads to a fall in spending.\n\nThey forecast that the benchmark S&P 500 will fall as low as 3,000 points in the first quarter, which would represent a 23% plunge from its level as of Tuesday's close.\n\nBut Detrick is more optimistic. He said that a combination of the weak dollar, inflation starting to fall towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and the US economy managing to avoid a recession could fuel a stock market surge.\n\n\"I think I'm open to the idea that we could have a surprise rally in the first half of next year with inflation coming back and the economy not going into recession,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\u00a0\n\n\"Everybody is bearish,\" Detrick added. \"Markets have a funny way of surprising the masses.\"",

These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! \n* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.\n\n---\n\n##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers\n\nThe worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.\n\nNow, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.\n\n**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**\n\nHere is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:\n\n### Horrible Brokers -

The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:\n\n* Apex Clearing\n* Barclays\n* IKBR\n\nWe don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.\n\nAdditionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.\n\nNote: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.\n\n---\nWe might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.\n\nThank you all for your patience, we are sorry new members are not able to comment yet, we promise you will be allowed to once this is over!",

So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,\" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.\n\nTesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models.\u00a0\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.\n\nMusk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally.",

        "post_text": "Boeing losing '$100 million to $150 million a day' as union strike rolls on Boeing (BA) finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place as the labor strike between it and the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union nears a second week.\n\nOn Monday, Boeing upped its offer to the union, which represents 33,000 workers, but did not proceed through union leadership and instead sent a \"best and final\" offer directly to workers, which didn\u2019t sit well with the IAM. Boeing\u2019s latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.\n\n\"The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,\" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. \"Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.\"\n\nEarlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in \u201cdirect talks\u201d after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.\n\nNevertheless, Boeing\u2019s insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.\n\nIAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a \u201cvery strong position,\u201d Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a \u201creputational level\u201d too.\n\nWith the strike hitting Boeing\u2019s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.\n\nShareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.\n\n\u201cBoeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they\u2019re losing between $100 million and $150 million,\u201d Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.\n\nWithout union workers based in Boeing\u2019s Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company\u2019s cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.\n\nMendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Boeing that\u2019s in trouble \u2014 the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,\u201d Mendiratta said. \u201cWhen there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.\u201d\n\nMendiratta doesn\u2019t see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing\u2019s latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.\n\nIAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a \u201cvery strong position,\u201d Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a \u201creputational level\u201d too.\n\nWith the strike hitting Boeing\u2019s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon.

Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:\n\n- General Motors\n- Rolls Royce\n- Trivago\n- Workhorse Group\n- Jaguar Health\n\nAnd [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).\n\nWhen boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. \n\n**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.\n\nHere is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):\n\n\n### Horrible Brokers -

Look past the politics for a moment and the restriction on rights whether they're fetal or those of living humans, for a moment please, and can we speculate on which industries will benefit from this ruling, based on some sort of objective premise?\n\nI for one, am even more bullish on healthcare, since restricting access to abortion reduces maternal and childhood life expectancy dramatically, I see this as a major tailwind for hospitals and the medical industry in general. This IMO will be an immediate boost to healthcare bottom line.  I can't imagine that job losses for childcare (US doesn't provide it for those outside of USA) will impact absolute numbers of insured, since the majority of those with jobs that provide healthcare benefits will likely be able to travel outside of the state that restricts abortion access. \n\nWhat other industries?\n\nEdit: Danco labs and Foundation Consumer Healthcare are private, not publicly traded (they make plan b and similar abortion medication).",

        "post_text": "Visa (V) vs PayPal (PYPL) **Why is Visa (V) is a better stock to buy than PayPal (PYPL) right now**\n\n**(This is also my first stock analysis so please leave some tips on what I can do better)**\n\nI have recently many people comment on the recent sell of in PayPal and visa, PayPal being the more drastic dip. This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal.\n\nHowever, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle.\n\n**Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently)**\n\nMany people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market.  I\u2019m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?\n\nOverall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa.\n\n**Growth**\n\nVisa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%\n\nPayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01\n\nWhile visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32\n\nIndicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nPayPal has no dividends currently\n\nVISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Margins**\n\nVisa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through.\n\nPayPal\u2019s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa\u2019s.\n\n**Concerns**\n\nFor me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor.\n\n**Overall,**\n\nThe growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal\u2019s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.",

        "post_text": "Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis **PLEASE LEAVE AN UPVOTE AND/OR COMMENT IF YOU USE. IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**\n\nDisclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.\n\nThis whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.\n\nYour exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**\n\n\\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.\n\n\\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)\n\n\\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.\n\n\\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.\n\n\\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.\n\n\\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.\n\n\\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \\[cell P4\\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \\[Q4\\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \\[R3\\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your \"worst case scenario\" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your \"best case scenario\" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your \"100% satisfied profit\"** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.\n\n\\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \\[column U\\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.\n\nTLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.\n\nOf course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!\n\n**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).\n\n1. [Alt 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6XkMn0c6OkHvyA0fWeTDVumpmU6btFYnsbY1z0GecM/edit?usp=sharing)\n2.

        "post_text": "A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this year Over the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&P 500 index this year. \n\nI am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) \n\nDespite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. \n\nMeanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. \n\nBut, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. \n\nThere are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&P. \n\nI have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. \n\nOne last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&P is not very ESG. Everybody \"buying the haystack\" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. \n\nIn summary, this is r/stocks. We should be encouraging informative and intellectual discussion about stocks, and not ridiculing fellow redditors like they're a bunch of idiots.",

If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Visa\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for V\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in V. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **39%** of their sales comes from **Data Processing Revenues**. Another **35%** comes from **Service** **Revenues**. **International Transaction Revenues** makes up for **20%** and the remaining **5%** are **Other Revenues.**\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 6,9%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for V\u00b4s stock of **$222 per share**. But because we have to account for **V\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$220 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith V\u00b4s price being at **$193** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s kind of undervalued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see V\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$498 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe V is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why I will start buying heavily every chance I get.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

I welcome your feedback of my opinions.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company\u2019s business model\n\n\u00a7 Visa at its core is a payment processor. Visa connects the buyer and seller while a financial partner provides the cash in to facilitate the transaction. These partners are paid the value of rewards (client incentives) to hold in escrow to pay to end users of their cards.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 They earn revenue by facilitating payments between customers and merchants, data processing revenues to facilitate clearing and settlement, International transactions allow them to earn fees to enable cross-currency transaction and finally other revenues which is mainly licensing fees. Together, the above makes up gross revenue.\n\n\u00a7 Their cards are used daily and are broken down between debit and credit transactions. Credit Cards are typically co-branded and affiliated with a bank (that provides the funds) and a company (which sets the terms of the awards). Debit cards are connected directly with a financial institution and allow you to pay directly from your account without providing your bank account number.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 No, they have $0.65 cents of debt for every $1.00 of equity and operate with an extremely high interest coverage ratio of 36x.\n\no Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, while revenues will rise and fall with the economy, there cards will be used continuously. They have access to $950 million of commercial paper with no balance outstanding.\n\n\u00a7 Visa also operates with a negative cash conversion cycle. This is in part enabled by collecting fees when they occur but pay rewards over time. This is tracked by capitalizing their rewards and making periodic payments.\n\n\u00b7 **Can it be Replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 For sure. There are only 4 players in the credit card market: Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discovery. Visa has been in the payment space for over 60 years. Despite technological changes, they continue to remain at the center of the payment industry for reasons will describe below.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. FCF margins have averaged a staggering 55.5% over the past 5 years, returns on assets over 15% over the past 5 years, steady revenue growth. Their financials are the envy of most of the world.\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 The advantage is to replace Visa, you need to find a method to have customers want to use your new payment system and need to have merchants who accept the payment method. Additionally, Visa wisely pays incentives for using their cards. This adds a further barrier as you would omit a benefit by not using their card. Given their unprecedented scale they can leverage their extremely low operating costs over a massive revenue base enabling these massive margins. A smaller player would not have this level of scale and would need to burn a significant amount of capital to scale. Take new players of late. Venmo was able to get users and replaced sending your friends cash or checks but has had a difficult time being accepted by merchants for fees. Apple and Android pay brought their massive consumer lists to the digital world, but still rely on the cards as they don\u2019t have the merchants nor do the programs offer rewards (outside of credit cards).\n\n\u00a7 Additionally, Visa has no fear that it won\u2019t be accepted. You know it is accepted virtually anywhere. Most consumers would not want the headache of a new payment system given the current system works so well.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 I don\u2019t believe so. Their advantage is not so much based on allocating capital for a long time. It\u2019s a brand of trusted secure payments with a well-entrenched network effect.\n\n\u00a7 I think it will be extremely difficult for a new player to get merchants, customers and fund an incentive for using their new payment system.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 The network effect for payments.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, this history of payments overall is a story not for the faint of heart for most players. New technologies are always trying to enter the mix. Whether its crypto, Venmo or Cash App or whatever other new methods come down the pike there will always be threats to this market.\n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 Yes\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Visa has grown revenues at 10% per year with stable fat margins. Cash still represents 20% of all transactions across the globe. This number will likely continue to dwindle over time giving Visa a nice tailwind to grow in excess of worldwide GDP growth +/- currency changes.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?\n\n\u00a7 I believe so.\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 I feel it would be extremely difficult to kill.\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 Revenue FYE 09/30/22 was $29.310 billion for 2022\n\n\u00a7 Revenue is forecast to be $39.451 billion for FYE 25\n\n\u00a7 Revenue is forecast to $54.61 billion for FY 28\n\n\u00a7 That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 10.41% from 22 to 25\n\n\u00a7 That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 11.49% from 25 to 28\n\n\u00a7 Shares have decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% per year over the past 3 and 5 years respectively. Most of these buybacks accrued with FCF yields of 3%. Since current FCF yield is slightly above this average, I feel it is fair to project that shares decrease a slightly more optimistic range of 1.5% to 2.25% per year.\n\n\u00a7 With current shares outstanding of 1.883 billion, this suggests shares outstanding are estimated be 1.75 to 1.80 billion shares on 09/30/25.\n\n\u00a7 Current dividend policy is $0.45 per quarter or $1.80 per share. Let\u2019s hold that going forward. Having said that it will likely rise over the next 2 years.\n\n\u00a7 Levered FCF margins are fairly stable. Lets assume 50% to 60% and I will use a 10% discount and premium to the estimated revenue with the low and high margins\n\n\u00a7 Putting it all together you get a FCF per share of $9.86 to $14.88 on 09/30/25.\n\n\u00a7 FCF Yields have averaged 3.2% over the past 5 years. Given the companies entrenchment and some cyclicality and that 3 years after 2025 its current expectations are to maintain a 10+% growth rate, a 3.5% to 4.5% FCF yield is fair in my view.\n\n\u00a7 To value the company, I assumed the high FCF per share will be associated with higher yields and lower FCF per share will be paired with lower yield. This gives a range of value per share on 09/30/2025 of $281.79 to $330.64.\n\n\u00a7 Currently shares are selling for $207 which implies a 15.6% annual return at the midpoint.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 I believe so, a company with the risk characterized in Visa in my view should be selling at a price that would yield the same as the market, call it 10%. That implies a price of $239 per share given my expectations.\n\n\u00a7 Given my expectations, Visa seems to be modestly undervalued\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NYSE:V](https://finbox.com/NYSE:V)\n\n10-K 09/30/22: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001403161/f4eefdcf-6779-4b32-a56f-6201f3ee3523.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001403161/f4eefdcf-6779-4b32-a56f-6201f3ee3523.pdf)\n\nCurrently Long V",

        "post_text": "IRL V vs MA Investment Research/Experiment Context: One of the ways I make money during the summer is at my summer job, where I oversee a few other employees at a mini golf/driving range/batting cage place. My main job is not to work registers but I do help a little bit on them. \n\nI have been wanting to invest in one of either V or MA but I was unsure which to choose. So today I had the idea to take a tally of every debit/credit card I got to see which type people were using, basically the parking lot test for debit/credit cards. There were purchases today ranging from $8-$300\n\nThis was in a 3.5 hour span and wasn\u2019t nearly all the customers that came, just all the customers I was on a register for. I had 54 total tally marks. With the following results,\n\nVisa - 62.9%\nMastercard- 29.6%\nAMEX - 7.4%\n\nI was curious what my results looked like compared to the market share I could find online. The market share I found online was \n\nVisa - 61.1%\nMastercard - 25.4%\nAMEX - 11.3%\nDiscover - 2.1%\n\nThis was pretty similar to the results I found in my small sample size which I thought was cool.\n\nThis lead me to the question, which company should I invest in? MA or V? I originally thought V because they are the most popular card and have the most expensive transactions (not in my data but found on the website I found the market share - statista). But then I thought about MA because of the greater opportunity to increase market share. V would be better if the market grows but MA would be more feasible if the market is stagnant is what I was originally thinking.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked into financials or anything like that yet I was just going off of reasoning and other data so far, but basically the whole point of this long post was to share my experiment and ask if you like V or MA more as a long term investment (I\u2019m 17 so I have 30-50 year window). \n\n\n",

        "post_text": "I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*\r  \n\r  \n*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company\u2019s financial statements or the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY\u2019s first audit on the Company\u2019s behalf.*\r  \n\r  \n*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company\u2019s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the \u201cSpecial Committee\u201d) to review the matters and certain of the Company\u2019s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the \u201cReview\u201d). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*\r  \n\r  \n*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: \u201cwe are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee\u2019s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*Although the Company recognizes EY\u2019s decision is final, it disagrees with EY\u2019s decision to resign as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm \u2013 the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*\r  \n\r  \n*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY\u2019s resignation, (1) there were no \u201cdisagreements,\u201d as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY\u2019s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no \u201creportable events\u201d as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*\r  \n\r  \n*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company\u2019s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY\u2019s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*",

        "post_text": "Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share\n\nSPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. \u2014 Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.\n\nMore than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. \u201cThe whole thing was magical,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Branson\u2019s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company \u2014 Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon \u2014 has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.\n\nIn each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations \u2014 and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting their money where their mouth is, and they\u2019re putting their body where their money is,\u201d said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive, frankly.\u201d\n\nAt 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.\n\nAlthough Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots \u2014 David Mackay and Michael Masucci \u2014 and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.\n\nThis flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.\n\nStephen Colbert of the CBS program \u201cThe Late Show\u201d introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.\n\nWhen the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.\n\nMr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company\u2019s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.\n\nAs the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.\n\nFor well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson\u2019s company.\n\nAfter years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.\n\nFounding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career \u2014 and a fortune estimated at $6 billion \u2014 building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman\u2019s flair.\n\nWhat became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.\n\nThe Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.\n\nThe spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson\u2019s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group\u2019s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson\u2019s.\n\nVirgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors \u2014 and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company\u2019s flight suits.\n\nThe Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.\n\nMr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.\n\nThe first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.\n\nIn 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.\nThe mishap was revealed this year in the book \u201cTest Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut\u201d by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we didn\u2019t lose the vehicle and kill three people.\u201d\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.\n\nAlthough Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.\n\nHe will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.\n\nNeither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.\n\nThe company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule\u2019s windows, and called Virgin Galactic\u2019s Unity \u201ca high-altitude plane\u201d in contrast to New Shepard\u2019s rocket.\nMr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to join the club!\u201d he added in an Instagram post.\n\nBlue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic\u2019s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.\n\nJoy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.\n\nThe era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.\n\nIn December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.\n\nAnother company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.\n\nThe orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy \u2014 Axiom\u2019s three customers are paying $55 million each \u2014 while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.\n\nBut how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?\n\nCarissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. \u201cBased on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,\u201d she said in an email, \u201cwe see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.\u201d\n\nMr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.\n\n\u201cPer minute, it\u2019s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nTwo decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. \u201cWally Funk was one of our first customers,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThat would have been like 1998.\u201d\n\nThe ticket price then was $98,000.\n\nAt one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.\n\nNow this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires \u2014 Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.\n\n\u201cIf anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it\u2019s Branson and Bezos,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThey have the reach and the cachet.\u201d",

        "post_text": "Elon Musk laid off the Tesla Supercharger team; now he\u2019s rehiring them Two weeks ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk enacted widespread layoffs throughout the company, including the 500-strong team responsible for the brand's Supercharger. Now, Tesla is looking to hire some of them back, Bloomberg reports, as Musk promises to spend $500 million expanding the network.\n\nThe Supercharger network is inarguably Tesla's crown jewel. The company recognized early on that, even though its owners slow-charged at home each night, knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles.\n\nSince then, it has built out more than 2,000 charging stations in the US alone, with more than 25,000 plugs. More than that, the chargers invariably work, something that is often not true for other charging networks.\n\nSo successful is the Supercharger network that, over the course of last year, virtually every other automaker that sells or plans to sell EVs in the US has announced it will drop the CCS1 connector for the J3400 standard, originally developed by Tesla. But those announcements were about more than just switching plugs. Each time, the OEM also revealed it had negotiated access for its customers to the Supercharger network.\n\nThat made Musk's dismissal of the entire team responsible so hard to fathom. While the Supercharger network accounts for only about 5 percent of Tesla's revenues, that percent is poised to grow as more OEMs gain access. And although the charging experience for Tesla EVs at Superchargers is usually flawless, that's because it's optimized for a single make of car with just five different models; there's no guarantee that will prove true when cars from other brands try to charge.\n\nThe layoffs also appeared to put Tesla's plan to build a more powerful charger that would benefit cars using 800 V or 900 V architectures, including Audi, Porsche, Lucid, and others, on hold.\n\nWorse yet, dozens of Supercharger sites that were in the works have stalled out, according to multiple reports.\n\nBut last week, Musk announced that Tesla would spend more than $500 million building out more chargers, just days after saying the focus would instead be on uptime at existing locations. And to do that, Tesla will need to rehire a whole bunch of people.\n\nThat started with Max de Zegher, who was an executive under the previous head of Supercharging, Rebecca Tinucci. (At the time of the layoffs, Electrek reported that Musk got rid of the entire team because its Tinucci did not lay off enough workers on her own.)\n\nThis is not the first time Musk has had to back-track an impetuous business decision. In 2019, he decided to close all of Tesla's retail locations to pay for a cheaper version of the Model 3 sedan. Within two weeks that decision had been reversed, in no small part due to the legal consequences of breaking so many leases.\n\nSource: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/tesla-does-180-on-superchargers-rehiring-laid-off-staff-amid-new-plans/",

Morgan Stanley warns stocks could fall another 10% Earnings expectations for U.S. companies are \"deteriorating rapidly,\" according to a report from Morgan Stanley, which could exacerbate the stock market's year-to-date losses.\n\n\u201cReduced earnings estimates and unexpected negative economic factors could lead to a further 5% to 10% decline in the S&P 500,\u201d Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note on Monday. \"The U.S. now has the fastest deterioration in corporate earnings expectations of any region due to the severe 'over-earnings' of the past two years.\"\n\nU.S. stocks have tumbled this year amid high inflation, which the Federal Reserve is trying to tame by raising interest rates. The S&P 500 had fallen 16.6% this year as of Monday, and was on the verge of falling into a bear market last week.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of higher interest rates and high inflation, \"positive earnings news has played a key role in mitigating losses in U.S. stocks,\" Shalett said.\n\nIn Shalett's view, \"2022 was supposed to be a harvest year.\" Following the outbreak, U.S. stocks have had \"extraordinary\" results in 2020 and 2021 thanks to record government stimulus. But the Federal Reserve is now tightening monetary policy to cool the economy to rein in the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe \u201cre-pricing of stocks was driven by a reset of inflation expectations, Fed rate hikes and balance sheet reductions,\u201d she wrote. \"Profits and economic forecasts have to be adjusted, and forecasts based on the level of a V-shaped recovery in 2020-2021 are inaccurate because that level is unsustainable.\"\n\nThat \"revaluation\" has already begun, Shalett said. She sees last week's underperformance in the retail and tech sectors \"because of excess inventory, high costs and weakening price-related demand\" as a case in point.",

        "post_text": "Can't make sense of this market, so I'm still doing nothing I don't know what the f- is going on anymore.  Here's what's running around my head at the moment:\n\n1. Markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be close/contested and the markets don't like uncertainty.\n2. Markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear Biden win.\n3. Election is incredibly close and contested, government will likely be split, and yet the markets are rallying super hard.  The prevailing theory is that a Biden win with Republican senate will make it less likely that Biden will attack big tech and increase taxes.\n4. In spite of (3), a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package, which increases the likelihood of a double-dip recession.\n5. COVID still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore, which makes it more powerful as a potential risk.  If the numbers keep spiking, eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really won't like: hospitals getting overwhelmed and/or increasing lockdowns.  The latter will be much more likely to happen under Biden than Trump.\n6. The rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday.  Breadth indicators, like the TICK and NYAD, were flat yesterday.  This suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market (big tech) and not an \"everything is great, pile into the markets\" sentiment.\n7. The ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything.  Stocks have gone from pullback to mega-overbought in 3 days.  Major indices are more extended beyond their 8-day EMAs than since late Nov 2018, shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows.\n8. I've learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now: i) Time in the market is better than timing the market; ii) Think long term and focus on weekly charts; iii) Don't make emotional, reactionary decisions; iv) Don't get caught up in FOMO; v) Don't invest based on what you think the market will do, or what you want it to do, but on what it's actually doing.\n\nGiven that I can't make sense of all this right now, I'm sitting on my hands.  At the very least I'm going to see how this week plays out.",

Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.\n\nIt\u2019s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It\u2019s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla\u2019s own CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly four times International Business Machines \ufffc\u2019 (IBM) market cap.\n\nYou could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store\u2014or just buy Dollar General \ufffc (DG) and Dollar Tree \ufffc (DLTR).\n\nIt\u2019s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.\n\nWith $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA\u2019s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.\n\nIf you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla\u2019s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles.

Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.\n\"The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,\" brokerage TD Cowen said.\n\n\"It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.\"\n\nNews of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.\nBrokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.\nThe prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to \"see the intentions of the next administration,\" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.\n\n\"If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle.

That share is up 2.8 percentage points compared with total sales last year.\n\nDETROIT \u2014 As sales of all-electric vehicles grow more slowly than expected, major automakers are increasingly meeting their customers in the middle.\n\nMore and more companies are reconsidering the viability of hybrid cars and trucks to appease consumer demand and avoid costly penalties related to federal fuel economy and emissions standards.\n\nThe shifting strategies run counterintuitively to industrywide EV messaging of recent years. Many auto companies have begun to invest billions of dollars in all-electric vehicles, and the Biden administration has made a push to get more EVs on U.S. roadways as quickly as possible.\n\nBut hybrid vehicles \u2014 those with traditional internal combustion engines combined with EV battery technologies \u2014 could help the automotive industry lower fuel consumption and emissions in the short-term, while easing consumers into vehicle electrification.\n\nSales of traditional hybrid electric vehicles, or HEVs, such as the Toyota Prius, are outpacing those of all-electric vehicles in 2023, according to Edmunds. HEVs accounted for 8.3% of U.S. car sales, about 1.2 million vehicles sold, through November of this year. That share is up 2.8 percentage points compared with total sales last year.\n\nEVs made up 6.9% of sales heading into December, or roughly 976,560 units, up 1.7 percentage points compared with total sales last year. Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, accounted for only 1% of U.S. sales through November.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much talk over the past few years about the move toward electrification and sort of forgoing hybrids, but ... hybrids are not dead,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of insights. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of consumers out there that are interested in electrification, maybe not ready to go fully electric.\u201d\n\nHybrids can also cost less and relieve many concerns typically associated with EVs such as range anxiety and lack of charging infrastructure. The average hybrid this year cost $42,381, according to Edmunds. That\u2019s below the roughly $59,400 average for an EV; $60,700 for a PHEV; and $44,800 for a traditional vehicle.\n\nMorgan Stanley earlier this month said Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Hyundai Motor,\n\nincluding Kia, account for 9 out of 10 hybrid sales in the U.S. Representatives for those automakers said they are actively attempting to increase production and sales of hybrid vehicles in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhile the transition to full battery electric transportation will take time, hybrids and plug-in hybrids will play an equally important role in Kia America\u2019s near and mid-term goals,\u201d Eric Watson, vice president of Kia America sales, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAnd other companies, such as the Detroit automakers, are following suit.\n\n**Detroit Three automakers**\n\nThe Detroit automakers have varying strategies for hybrid vehicles.\n\nFord Motor offers PHEVs but is leaning into HEVs, announcing plans in September to double sales of the V-6 hybrid model during the 2024 model year to roughly 20% in the U.S. It\u2019s part of Ford CEO Jim Farley\u2019s plans to quadruple the company\u2019s production of gas-electric hybrids.\n\nFord\u2019s hybrid sales through November of this year are up 23% over the same period in 2022 to more than 121,000 units, or 6.8% of its total sales through that point. In comparison, Ford\u2019s EV sales are up 16.2% to roughly 62,500 units, accounting for 3.5% of its total sales.\n\n\n\nChrysler parent Stellantis, for its part, is leaning on PHEVs for its electrification strategy, before introducing a host of EVs starting next year. The company is the top seller of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the U.S., and the vehicles accounted for about 10% of the company\u2019s third-quarter sales, led by Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee SUVs.\n\nBut General Motors\n\nisn\u2019t ready just yet to alter its EV plans, which include a goal to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles by 2035.\n\nGM led the way for plug-in electric vehicles with the Chevrolet Volt during the 2010s. The company discontinued the vehicle in early 2019, citing demand and cost concerns.\n\nSince then, the automaker has not offered another hybrid vehicle in the U.S. other than the recently launched Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, a hybrid version of the famed sports car. GM does offer hybrids, including PHEVs, in China.\n\n\u201cWe still have a plan in place that allows us to be all light-duty vehicles EV by 2035,\u201d GM CEO Mary Barra said Monday during an Automotive Press Association meeting in Detroit. \u201cWe\u2019ll adjust based on where the customer is and where demand is. It\u2019s not going to be \u2018if we build it they will come.\u2019 We\u2019re going to be led by the customer.\u201d\n\nHer comments come after GM President Mark Reuss told CNBC in August that he was \u201cflexible\u201d regarding hybrids as a way of meeting federal regulations.\n\n\u201cIf it means we have to do that by law, then we have to do that by law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s regulations that get dealt on us, then we\u2019re going to look at everything in our toolbox to meet them.\u201d\n\n\n**Federal regulations**\n\nMajor auto companies, including the Detroit automakers, were counting on EVs to assist in offsetting the emissions and low fuel economies of larger SUVs and trucks that can cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in fines by the federal government.\n\nGM and Stellantis were forced to pay a combined $363.8 million in penalties for failing to meet federal fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks they produced in previous years, according to information published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in June.\n\nSuch fines would significantly increase under current proposals by the Biden administration to improve fuel efficiency of vehicles and move toward EVs, according to automaker lobbying groups.\n\nThe American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing the Detroit Three, earlier this year said the automakers would face more than $14 billion in noncompliance penalties between 2027 and 2032 barring significant changes to their fleets\u2019 overall fuel efficiency. U.S. automakers have separately warned the fines would cost $6.5 billion for GM, $3 billion at Stellantis and $1 billion at Ford, according to Reuters.\n\nNHTSA in July proposed boosting fuel efficiency requirements by 2% per year for passenger cars and 4% per year for pickup trucks and SUVs from 2027 through 2032, resulting in a fleetwide average fuel efficiency of 58 mpg.\n\nWith EVs playing a lesser role than anticipated to boost those fleetwide averages, hybrids could save automakers millions.\n\n\u201cEven without electric vehicles, there\u2019s an expectation that electrification of an internal combustion engine is going to be necessary to meet regulations anyway,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility.\n\n**Industry leader**\n\nThe resurgence of hybrids is especially important for Toyota. The world\u2019s largest automaker is considered the pioneer of traditional hybrids, with the Prius.\n\nThe company ironically became a target of environmental groups last year for its strategy to move forward with a mix of hybrids, PHEVs and EVs, which critics viewed as a lack of commitment to an all-electric future.\n\nToyota\u2019s argument at the time, and still, is that it\u2019s meeting consumer needs and planning for a more gradual global adoption that will naturally include some markets shifting to EVs sooner than others.\n\nThe company further says it takes into account the entire environmental impact of producing EVs compared with hybrid electrified vehicles, arguing it can produce eight 40-mile plug-in hybrids for every one 320-mile battery electric vehicle and save up to eight times the carbon emitted into the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cPeople are finally seeing reality,\u201d Toyota Chairman and former CEO Akio Toyoda, who has been heavily criticized for the slower approach on EVs, said in October regarding EVs, according to The Wall Street Journal.",

        "post_text": "The Chinese stock market is notching its strongest weekly gain since 2014. The CSI300 is up by 12.4% this week so far, which is its strongest weekly gain since December 2014 (+13.4%). By the end of the day, it could be strongest weekly gain since 2008. I know we hate investing in China in this sub, but there might be a point for adding a bit of China back into your portfolio today. There are two main investment theses:\n\n1. The Chinese consumer is not financially weak, they are simply sentiment driven.\n2. Chinese government support for the market is sending the signal for retail investors to invest.\n\n**Point 1:** Context for today's environment. Chinese stock market pessimism reached peak in February 2024 as it appeared the government was not keen to provide policy support. This was a mistake in messaging by the CCP. Chinese investing culture is extremely different from the US. While US markets are more sophisticated and fundamental driven - Chinese investors are HIGHLY sentimental. Western media blames the collapse of real estate for the past 2-years of market underperformance, this is true, but not because its hurting Chinese people's financial health. It's the severing of trust in the government (that they would bail out the real estate firms and save the people's money and investment properties) that is the problem. The Chinese gross savings ratio sits at \\~44%  - unlike US consumers and investors (US personal savings rate is 3%) who CAN'T spend if the market collpases, the Chinese are simply choosing not to consume or invest. \n\nSo what does all this mean? It means the CCP needs to send the strongest possible message to the Chinese people that it will support the market and help the property industry. It doesn't actually have to do anything like a massive bailout, but it needs to be performative and convincing - like the Fed is in the US. Once sentiment swings positive, all that unallocated capital floods right back into the market - especially if it becomes a 'government-approved' medium. \n\n**Point 2:** And that's exactly what the CCP has done in the past week. It TELEVISED a PBOC announcement on a range of (tbh low-impact) fiscal policies. Then XJP called for an \"emergency\" politburo meeting to implement \"forceful\" rate cuts and support for real estate. They even allowed state-owned-entities (basically government fund managers) to borrow from the PBOC just to buy and prop up broad market indices. This is hugely sentiment swinging. The CCP is essentially saying to its people that \"you can invest safely, we are going to prioritise the market\", and retail is responding. \n\nThe fact that the Chinese market might be having its strongest weekly gain since 2014 is pretty convenient because this coincides with the 2014 bubble when the Chinese government incentivised its citizens to invest in the market - a similar environment to today. What happened then:\n\n1. The CSI almost DOUBLED between late 2014 to mid-2015. \n2. It caused one of the biggest bubbles and crashes in Chinese market history.\n\nIMO if the market is headed for a V-shape recovery, China does not appear to be a long-term play. But there is a lot to be gained from the compressed spring that is Chinese equities rn. China Tech is arguably their strongest suite of stocks (fundamentally) and they have been going absolutely gangbusters over this week. I see strong upside over a 1-year time horizon, with downside risk being political tensions w/ US and CCP failure to follow through with policy support. I would reduce portfolio exposure approaching 2021 stock market peaks in the case of market exuberance. The ideal scenario is a slow-down or even correction to allow for more sustainable recovery. In which case, corrections represent compelling entry-points.\n\n(Disclosure: 55% of my portfolio is in HK and I am up 15% over 1 week.)",

There\u2019s no denying that we\u2019re not too far away from a policy driven EV adoption wave of massive proportions. All the top global car markets are very much aligned on this:\n\n**China - Biggest car market:** The Chinese government has implemented a quota system to limit the number of gasoline-powered cars sold in the country.\n\n**US - Second biggest car market:** This rollout will likely happen state by state (California\u2019s EV mandate is leading the pack). On a federal level, Biden's EPA wants to enact a mandate that will push for two-thirds of all new vehicles to be electric by 2032.\n\n**EU - Third biggest car market:**\u00a0The EU has the strictest EV adoption goals with all new cars and vans registered set to be zero emission by 2035.\n\nJapan, Indian, Canada, UK, and 80 more countries are also implementing aggressive EV adoption mandates all set on meeting a 2030 - 2035 deadline.\n\nLike many things macro, the global adoption curve will be initially incremental with a very sharp turn appearing outta nowhere around the halfway point. I\u2019m betting that it will take place around 2027 - 2030. A few things that strengthen this hypothesis:\u00a0\n\n1. \u00a0Global relations and supply chain deterioration as a result of regional conflict, brics, etc.\n2. \u00a0Countries are finally investing on sovereign energy assets to mitigate 3rd party risk (Russia, Saudi, etc).\n3. Institutional, public and private capital incentives (grants for charging infrastructure, tax perks, etc).\n\nDoes that mean that I\u2019m going Yolo on EV automakers? No, not for a while at least - they have a tough hill to climb (R&D costs, retail saturation, infra costs, the list goes on).\n\nI prefer to make calculated plays with ironclad lithium exploration, drilling and refining stocks.The lithium industry is going through an aggressive m&a phase because they know that the majority of all deposits just aren\u2019t viable exploration plays (geographical conundrums, costs, environmental compliance\u2026just too much red tape).\n\nIn regards to alternatives like nuclear, thorium, sodium ion, hydrogen are either stuck in bureaucratic quagmires or their just liquidity trap hyped shenanigans.\n\nAnyhow, I\u2019m stacking up on lithium mining stocks . Do you have any cool lithium plays on your watchlist or portfolio?  \n\n\n\\* Getting dozens of messages from people asking me which lithium stocks I am bullish on. I have broad market exposure via ETFs and bluechip miners ($ALB,x$MALRY, $RIO).   \nMy only hot play rn is Li-FT Power ($LIFT.V / $LIFFF) - one the largest lithium mining projects in North America with a track record of putting out stellar drill results one after the other. DYOR always but I'm accumulating and waiting for the resource estimate which should happen sometime this year.",

I understand dividend growth but a lot of these companies increase dividend by minuscule amounts every year. Many of them have high stock prices which means the dividend yield is often 2-5% which trails the returns from index ETFs. Many are also not increasing their stock prices significantly.\n\nI have boiled my confusion down into two questions.\n\n1. A lot of dividend kings and aristocrats are a part of index ETF\u2019s. Why buy one dividend aristocrat when you can benefit from buying a basket of them? What is the advantage of buying and holding a stock individually over an ETF?\n\n2. Would any dividend aristocrat or king provide a similar ROI as KO did for Buffett? What criteria do you use to select a stock that will provide such a high ROI?",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021.\n\n# **The end of the quarter could create volatility for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/the-end-of-the-quarter-could-create-volatility-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could be buffeted by end-of-quarter trading in the week ahead, as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios.\n*****\n> The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings, to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings.\n*****\n> The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House\u2019s infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.\n*****\n> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.\n*****\n> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They\u2019re trying to figure it out.\u201d\n*****\n> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.\n*****\n> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.\n*****\n> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat right now,\u201d said NatWest\u2019s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.\n*****\n> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.\n*****\n> \u201cIf anything, we\u2019re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> # Infrastructure plan\n> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.\n*****\n> \u201cThe Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don\u2019t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I\u2019m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.\u201d\n*****\n> Gwinn said the market has \u201cfiscal fatigue.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it\u2019s going to be passed, when it\u2019s going to be passed and whether it\u2019s going to be passed ... It\u2019s not tangible enough,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.\n*****\n> # Rotation\n> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.\n*****\n> \u201cI think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that\u2019s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.\u201d\n*****\n> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.\n*****\n> \u201cAs we\u2019re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,\u201d he said. \u201cTo their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy \u2014 energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they\u2019re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vO6bgbd.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DHyy0jK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/r9toVhW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WsvEjsM.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Yifrz8S.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ciosFuJ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mlnREkj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CtwxDvI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DIpCmjL.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a57hPvk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/up2SDlt.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/16Psc5m.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TSJJQus.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/pLkbs1k.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month \u2013 Up 15 in a Row\n\n> April marks the end of the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.\n\n> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, \u201cTax\u201d month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).\n\n> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.\n\n> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that \u201cwork-from-home\u201d stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.\n\n> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April\u2019s performance since 1953. April is DJIA\u2019s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9044f7ae02c5c0f0137bff0911ef7cb6/1367b75d549eb11f-fe/s400x600/d969c7c83e5a15cfb4c671e0a9ca959aa6c9fc54.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Historic Year for the S&P 500\n\n> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.\n\n> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**\n\n> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-Sector-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities\n\n> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.\n\n> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cAfter likely their worst period in history, although I wasn\u2019t around for the bubonic plague so I can\u2019t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.\u201d\n\n> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market\u2019s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the \u201cstay at home environment\u201d benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December\u2014even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.\n\n> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.\n\n*****\n\n> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**\n\n> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low \u2013 actually it\u2019s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.\n\n> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn\u2019t bad either.\n\n> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals \u2013 and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA \u201cSell in May\u201d).\n\n> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let\u2019s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means \u201cbearish\u201d perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 26th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.28.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/a57hPvk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/7ZBW7kO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!]())**\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.29.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KCFoZ0p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 3.29.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/A79uQcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  3.30.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTM92oZ.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.30.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CO3uIVi.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.31.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/T13r2c7.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.31.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4o0Mk0k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.1.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE7bg7B.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.1.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWonNMB.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.2.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.2.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # BlackBerry Limited $9.63\n**BlackBerry Limited (BB)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 5:05 PM ET on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Personally I find my highest returns to date to be stocks under $20 a share as I can buy 5x-10x the shares or more and any increase is exponentially more then my higher valued stocks. For example I own 100 shares of stock x at $114 a share, it increases to $124 a share profiting $1000 total. Or my other, I own 10,000 shares of stock y at $4 a share, it increases to $8 a share profiting $40,000 total... to me the cheaper shares are the better option and in my experience safer as drops tend to be less value so less loss.",

        "post_text": "DD: Neo Lithium Corp : NLC.V:TSX Hello Everyone, \n\nThis is my first post here, and I'm going to be explaining some DD on Neo Lithium Corp. You can read for yourself some of the information I have [here](https://www.neolithium.ca/index.php). **All of the $ values in this post will be in CAD - Canadian Dollars**\n\n**Fundamentals:** \n\nNLC is a lithium/lithium carbonate mining company headquartered in Toronto, and operating in Argentina. They are traded on the TSX, under the ticker symbol **NLC.V.** They are planning to operate in the Lithium Triangle, a region in Argentina/Chile/Bolivia **LOADED** with Lithium. Approximately 27% of the worlds Lithium supply is mined out from this region, and 12% of which is located in Argentina, where Neo Lithium Corp is operating. The area in which they operate is 100% owned by Neo Lithium Corp, which lowers external risks from competitors operating in the area. More info on the competitors will be included below in the risks section.\n\nNow, into the good stuff. Currently, NLC is priced at $1.56 / share (@close December 27th) with a market capitalization of \\~$187M. Yes, I know, the market cap is quite small compared to other big industrial companies, however this company is fresh and is showing great upside potential. Recently, they secured an \\~$8.6M deal with CATL, a massive Chinese lithium battery manufacturer, where 10.2M shares were sold to CATL. This is good news because it means that this company is getting noticed and people are buying in. NLC has a strong net cash position, approximately $35M, with little to no debt. The no-debt thing was mentioned in their investor presentation, but take it with a grain of salt. I believe they have little debt, but it would be foolish to assume that they are completely debt-free, however, they are in a great position cash-wise. Approximately 9% of outstanding shares are owned by company insiders, 40% belonging to institutional ownership, and the remaining 51% being publicly owned. The volume on average is \\~290k which is quite low, but is steadily increasing as the days go by. I expect to see a massive volume increase by the spring.\n\nSpeaking of the spring, the last peace to this puzzle is **to obtain the construction permit.** Once this permit is granted, the company will be fully operational and start generating revenue. As this happens, news will come out and with that, attract investors to this company. There is no definitive date where this permit will be granted, however I expect it to happen before Q3 of 2021. When this permit is granted, and revenue starts being generated, I expect the stock to rise by AT LEAST $3 by Q4 2021. The best thing about this is that the price currently is dirt cheap. Yes, I know, stocks that are priced this low are quite volatile and risky, however, it is up to you and your personal risk tolerance to decide if this play is right for you. I've included a risk section to detail every risk that could be potentially threatening to this company. Continuing on, you will be able to absolutely load up with shares on this company and by the time summer of 2021 comes around, you should be able to realize a large gain. Please note that this play will take anywhere from a few months to a year to actually make you some money, however if they are successful in operations then holding longer will prove more profitable.\n\n**MY POSITION (CURRENTLY) : 122 shares @ $1.50 / share.** I would like to say that while I would love to buy more shares, I'm a semi-broke college student with not a lot of money to invest, so I'm doing the best I can. I do plan on buying more shares with any money received over the holidays. Please refrain from making fun of my positions, lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TA:** \n\nRight off the bat I'm going to admit I'm no saint at Technical Analysis. I have watched quite a bit of videos, and gained a minimal amount of knowledge in TA. However, the rule of thumb stands, which is **to conduct your own TA**. This is simply DD.  I'm going to include my share of TA so that you guys can get an idea of how the stock is performing, however it's definitely best if anyone interested conducts further TA.\n\n[This](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=NLC.V) link is the link to the [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) graph of NLC. It includes the RSI, MA (50/200), and the MACD chart. Starting with the RSI, this stock fluctuates in between 50 and 70, and ATM is at 61.15. This is a decent rating as it indicates the security is neither underbought/overbought. It fluctuates periodically over 70, only to drop immediately after. It typically drops a few cents when it peaks above 70, but typically recovers once it hits \\~50.\n\nMoving on to the candlestick chart w/ moving averages. As seen in many other securities, the 50 day Moving Average acts as a support line, and you can see for yourself how it bounces after it comes close/touches the support line. Both moving averages are showing bullish symbols, so that is always good. \n\nLooking at the MACD indicator, as I'm writing this the EMA's are bottoming out after a bearish 2 weeks. I expect to see a nice, bullish 1-2 weeks coming. The indicator shows lots of people selling, but the number of which dropping each week, which to me is bullish. The candlesticks are currently showing a bullish uptrend above the support line but looking at how the stock has performed in the last 6 months I think it will continue to bounce, which is inline with what the MACD indicator is showing. \n\n**TA TL;DR:** Technical Analysis of this security is showing a bullish trend in the coming weeks.\n\n**Risks:** \n\n**Risk #1: Construction Permit Not Granted.**\n\nThe first main risk with this play is the construction permit getting blocked. This would be absolutely detrimental to the company as the future of NLC is entirely dependent on this permit being granted. There are 2 reasons that I believe would be the cause of the permit being denied\n\n* **COVID-19**\n   * Obviously, COVID-19 is a serious risk to tons of businesses this year. If COVID-19 continues it's rampage on the world we might see the local government in Argentina cancelling any concurrent operations. This could mean a delay in getting the construction permit, and if granted, a pause in the construction process. We also have to take into account that COVID-19 procedures in Toronto may cause delays in decision making/administrative related-decisions. Ultimately, most of the risk from COVID-19 is focused in Argentina.\n* **Argentinian government changes their mind.**\n   * I really do not see this happening, but I'm just including it juuuuust in case. Other companies already operate in this area and have been for quite a while, so the odds of this happening are quite slim. If it does happen, its not good news for NLC.\n\n**Risk #2 - Competition**\n\nThis is a risk that occurs in any industry. Competition is inevitable, and some may see it as a bad thing but I see an increase in competition as a sign of money to be made. Most of the worlds lithium is produced by \"the big three\": **Albermarle Corp, FMC Corp, and SQM (**Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile)\n\n* **Albermarle Corp** mines lithium in CHILE\n* **FMC Corp** mines lithium in ARGENTINA, however the lithium division of the company is a separate entity \n* **SQM** mines lithium in CHILE\n\nSince NLC is going to be operating in Argentina, the main competitor is FMC Corp. FMC Corp is a big company, however they operate in an area hundreds of miles away from where NLC is going to be mining. Also mentioned above, NLC owns 100% of the massive area where they operate, so it's almost safe to say that FMC Corp will not be a huge risk in terms of generating profit\n\n**Risk #3 - Switch from Lithium batteries to some other variant**\n\nThis risk is close to impossible from happening, however there's a sliver of a chance that some big, blockbuster switch from lithium batteries to some other compound occurs, where most lithium mining companies would be heavily impacted. I highly, highly doubt this is going to happen in the next 2-3 years, so its a very small risk.\n\nWell, this is the end of my DD. Please feel free to comment your thoughts, ask questions, or call something out I may have missed/overlooked. I'm no JPM analyst, just a 20 year old trying to make some money.",

As far as cashback on everything goes, that\u2019s basically unbeatable. As the economy grows and people (hopefully) improve their credit, the better cards its competition offers will attract the newer generations of credit card holders. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s my completely speculative and uneducated DD.",

Is this a violation or is the question itself ok to ask? Please remove if a problem. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work for a company traded on the Canadian TSX-V  and  the USA OTC markets. But I live in Ireland. I have some options that have vested and I want to exercise those options and either immediately sell them or sell to cover the cost of buying them. If I don't sell all of them immediately, I will want to sell all of them within the next 6 months. I have questions...\n\n1. I need to find a broker to do this for me.  I think finding a local broker who can buy these for me is not easy. And I am nervous of using, say, a US or Canadian broker. I imagine there are regulations around who can sell what to whom. I want to keep the associated costs of doing the transaction down. So avoiding an annual fee.\n2. I'd prefer if they could cover the cost of buying rather than me having to pay. And I am trying to understand if a calculation of the exercise and sell to cover would include the tax liability or is that a separate thing or can I tell them what I think the tax will be and ask them to sell enough to cover the purchase price, plus taxes, plus commissions/fees?\n3. Am I right in thinking that if I expect the price to go up in the near term, then the best thing is to exercise the options, pay the income tax now on the current price (which is >40%) and then I'll only be hit for capital gains tax (33%) if I sell later and the price has gone up?\n\nMy thanks in advance,\n\nTheFullIrish",

Despite the claim of the \u201c10x Discovery Service\u201d to identify putative future \u201cten-baggers,\u201d none of the stocks approached this return. At 18-22% inflation since January 2021, three of the five non-loss positions lost ground or were stagnant in inflation-adjusted returns (Live Oak Bankshare 0.29% return, CrowdStrike 20.93%, and Walker Dunlop at 21.93%). Only two had positive inflation-adjusted returns: Bitcoin (99.95%) and Kinsale Capital Group (122.1%).\n\nThe Fool\u2019s 30 recommendations were overwhelmingly cash flow negative stocks with poor fundamentals. Nonetheless, their various services doubled down, for instance recommending Fiverr (FVRR) three times at over $200 within a four-month period. It sells for $22.72 today. While these recommendations did not discover any 10x returns, they did discover 1/10th returns. Lemonade (LMND) was another repeat recommendation across multiple Motley Fool services. It has fallen over 80% and continues to lose over $200 million annually with no clear path to profitability.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s comparisons of their claimed returns to the S&P 500 are misleading, as their recommendations here are overwhelmingly high-risk tech companies with poor fundamentals. Even the NASDAQ is not a good comparison as the latter is weighted towards larger, more stable and financially successful firms. Such comparisons also do not consider the that the \"risk premium\" of the Fool's highly speculative recommendations demands significantly higher returns to justify the risk. The proper peer group is (mostly speculative, mostly tech) cash-flow negative small-cap growth stocks.\n\nThe results do not support the Motley Fool's claims of outperformance for their 10x Discovery service. Different dates can be referenced for stock prices during my subscription period (mid 2020-mid-2021) with substantially similar results.\n\nMany of these recommendations are recycled among their various services. It is also my belief from these data and personal experience as an investor who bought virtually every recommendation across multiple premium services of the Motley Fool that their other services also widely underperformed the market during this period.\n\nDisclosures: I have small open positions on Zoom (ZM) and Bitcoin initiated earlier this year, but none related to my prior Motley Fool membership. I have no plans to initiate a position in any of the securities listed above in the next month.",

The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.\n\nThe entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.\n\nBut as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.\n\nThe main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was.

Same shit with Alibaba in China, except to an even larger extent. 800 million people aren\u2019t going to switch over to something else.",

Paypal at PE of 48.6\n\nMastercard at 43.6\n\nVisa at 37.4\n\nWhile Paypal is the most expensive purely from PE point of view, I'm leaning more towards them because they've historically had higher revenue growth compared to the other two and they're diversified or are trying to diversity into things like crypto, stock broker, etc. Also Paypal is around 33% off from its 52 week high, which is far lower than V or MA.\n\nIf you had to pick one out of these 3?

        "post_text": "Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.\n\nHere is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.\n\n[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \\- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  \n[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \\- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security\u2019s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.\n\n[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \\- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.\n\n[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \\- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.\n\n[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \\- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a \"cloud\" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.\n\n[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \\- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.\n\nMA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.\n\nPivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.\n\nSAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.\n\nSuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",

        "post_text": "IRL V vs MA Investment Research/Experiment Context: One of the ways I make money during the summer is at my summer job, where I oversee a few other employees at a mini golf/driving range/batting cage place. My main job is not to work registers but I do help a little bit on them. \n\nI have been wanting to invest in one of either V or MA but I was unsure which to choose. So today I had the idea to take a tally of every debit/credit card I got to see which type people were using, basically the parking lot test for debit/credit cards. There were purchases today ranging from $8-$300\n\nThis was in a 3.5 hour span and wasn\u2019t nearly all the customers that came, just all the customers I was on a register for. I had 54 total tally marks. With the following results,\n\nVisa - 62.9%\nMastercard- 29.6%\nAMEX - 7.4%\n\nI was curious what my results looked like compared to the market share I could find online. The market share I found online was \n\nVisa - 61.1%\nMastercard - 25.4%\nAMEX - 11.3%\nDiscover - 2.1%\n\nThis was pretty similar to the results I found in my small sample size which I thought was cool.\n\nThis lead me to the question, which company should I invest in? MA or V? I originally thought V because they are the most popular card and have the most expensive transactions (not in my data but found on the website I found the market share - statista). But then I thought about MA because of the greater opportunity to increase market share. V would be better if the market grows but MA would be more feasible if the market is stagnant is what I was originally thinking.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked into financials or anything like that yet I was just going off of reasoning and other data so far, but basically the whole point of this long post was to share my experiment and ask if you like V or MA more as a long term investment (I\u2019m 17 so I have 30-50 year window). \n\n\n",

I feel like there\u2019s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who\u2019ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon\n\nIs there anyone out there that thinks that won\u2019t happen?\n\nI can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. \n\nBut we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they\u2019re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they\u2019re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?\n\nSame with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can\u2019t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). \n\nI know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching \u201cMaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent\u201d are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)\n\nWith investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won\u2019t happen?",

        "post_text": "Mastercard (MA) DCF Analysis ***Note: Not Financial Advice***\n\n# Introduction:\n\nMA is one of the duopoly in the card network business. The card network business is a unique model that heavily rewards first mover advantage, with large barriers to entry due to the large fixed cost associated with setting up POS, achieving large merchant acceptance locations, and gaining the trust of major financial institutions. The card network business has large potential but also large hurdles to overcome, with regulators and competitors all eyeing a piece of MA's business.\n\n# Market:\n\nAPAC and some EMEA have one of the lowest credit card penetration rates as their society is \u201cless developed\u201d due to a lack of the relevant and appropriate infrastructure to support cashless payments ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/675371/ownership-of-credit-cards-globally-by-country/)).\r  \n\r  \nI believe that most of the developing world would follow a similar trend as China in terms of how payment has progressed. In the early 2010s, China was mostly a cash-based society ([SOURCE](https://www.thunes.com/news/china-payment-trends-and-popular-payment-methods/#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20biggest%20market,and%20credit%20cards%20also%20used)) coincidentally then, smartphone penetration in the market was \\~75%. Both Alipay and WeChat pay with a large user base took advantage of that and introduced mobile payments. Part of the growth equation was also due to mass merchant adoption, as merchants only needed QR codes without the need for costly POS systems that traditional credit cards require.\r  \n\r  \nA potential competitor to credit cards is P2P payments like Venmo where payments are made directly from 1 party to the other through mobile wallets ([SOURCE](https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/south-africas-digital-payments-plan-takes-a-page-from-indias-upi)). However, the largest flaw with P2P payment is that since transactions are instantaneous the onus is on the consumer to verify the legitimacy of a transaction before proceeding. P2P payments don't have the same extensive fraud protection that traditional credit card payments offer.\r  \n\r  \nIn India, a credit card is still seen as a \u201cpremium\u201d product with credit cards only having a penetration rate of 5.5% ([SOURCE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2023/06/22/why-credit-card-adoption-is-rising-in-india/?sh=29b76dcb5589)). However, getting in the way of mass credit card adoption is the competing United Payment Interface(UPI). UPIs are smartphone applications that allow for peer-to-peer RTP between merchants and consumers. UPI already has a strong foothold in India at 50 million merchant acceptance locations. The future going forward will be that UPI will be able to be linked to credit cards. \u201cIn terms of data, around INR 39 bn count of UPI transactions were recorded in 2021, compared to INR 211 Mn credit cards POS transactions\u201d ([SOURCE](https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/blog/will-upi-kill-credit-/debit-cards-in-the-coming-years-/91535955)).\r  \n\r  \nMobile payments could lead to the acceleration of the growth of transactions using credit/debit cards. However, mobile payments do take a cut out of the fees so it could cut into MA\u2019s topline. This would be an even more prevalent issue in the future when these mobile payment providers have an established reward system rivaling traditional credit card companies.\r  \n\r\r  \n\rOver the upcoming decade, ASEAN is expected to be the fastest-growing emerging market ([SOURCE](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/asean-economic-outlook-in-2024-jan24.html)) fueled by robust global Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), strong recovery of the tourism sector in the region, and the rebound of domestic consumption of their larger trade partners e.g. China and India which drives ASEAN\u2019s exports, this effect is further compounded as certain of their trade partners have an aging population with large disposable income. The kinds of exports that ASEAN is expected to contribute to will be in the form of raw material, and value-added exports e.g. semiconductors. ASEAN is expected to grow at a Y/Y CAGR rate of 10.00% over the next 13 years ([SOURCE](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/asean-economic-outlook-in-2024-jan24.html)).   \n\n\n# Revenue:\n\nMastercard breaks down its revenue into \u201cpayment network\u201d and \u201cvalue-added services and solutions\u201d.\r  \n\r  \n**Payment Network**\r  \nPayment network is when MA charges a % fee based on Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) of all mastercard-related transactions, GDV is calculated through purchases made using an MA-branded card.\r  \n\r  \nMA is building out its service to roll out in China, so far, it has partnered with ICBC and Bank of Communications, but they have a long road ahead to establish its presence in China. Initially, to pay using Alipay or WeChat in China, you have to open a Chinese bank account. However, Alipay and WeChat have begun allowing consumers to link the app to their foreign credit card. China is the perfect ground for MA to establish itself, given that the value of mobile transactions in China in 2022 is 500 Trillion Yuan ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1060702/china-mobile-payment-transaction-value/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20total%20transaction,payment%20transactions%20in%20the%20country)).\n\nI believe that payment network should be broken down into APMEA and Non-APMEA, APMEA represents a large growth opportunity as the APMEA region is beginning to explore mobile payments and global e-commerce. Whereas the Non-APMEA region represents a mature region that has little wiggle room left to grow.\r  \n\r\r  \n\r  \n***APMEA***\r  \nWhen forecasting the number of transactions, I forecasted it with a backloaded growth rate as I believe that GDV for APMEA will grow heavily through a larger number of transactions as more and more people in the APMEA region are wealthy enough to be offered the luxury of a credit card. On top of that, the growing smartphone penetration rate and growth in mobile wallets all help to boost the total number of transactions.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting the GDV/Transactions, I believe that historically GDV/Transaction had been declining for APMEA due to the poor macro environment from COVID-19 affecting disposable income of the APMEA region which leads to unwillingness to make purchases. However, I assume that it takes another 1 year of forecast for the lingering effects of COVID-19 to dissipate and for consumers to regain the confidence to make bigger purchases. On top of that, I believe that in the future GDV/Transaction in the APMEA region will grow in part due to the rising disposable income of these countries attributed to their strong forecasted GDP growth, and as consumers get used to the convenience of MA and trust the reliability & security of their payment network, they will utilize MA for a greater number of transactions leading to higher GDV per transaction.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting %GDV earned, opting for less granularity I forecasted it to taper towards the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n\r  \n***Non-APMEA***  \nWhen forecasting the number of transactions, I assumed that the Non-APMEA regions are sufficiently matured so the number of transactions is unlikely to have any large spikes. So, I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  \nWhen forecasting the GDV/Transaction, I assumed that the Non-APMEA regions are sufficiently matured so there are unlikely to be any large spikes. So, I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  \nWhen forecasting %GDV earned, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of perpetual inflation rate. This is especially true given how there is growing legislation against MA and VISA in the Western world for holding a duopoly. So, I assumed that MA or VISA would be unlikely to raise %GDV earned through higher merchant discount rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Value-added services and solutions***\r  \nValue-added services and solutions refer to MA\u2019s other services e.g. Cyber and Intelligence solutions, open banking solutions, etc.\r MA believes that value-added services and solutions help to drive payment network. \u201cAnd if you look at some of these big wins\u2026all have a significant contribution of services\u2026oftentimes, they are one of the reasons that we win those deals\u201d - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. A few examples of the services MA provides are:\r  \n\r  \n1) Data, because MA handles a large number of transactions they accumulate a lot of consumer data. MA acquired a personalization company to help merchants analyze data to make personalized recommendations.\r  \n\r  \n2) Biometric, MA is looking for new ways to make payment even more seamless through using biometric data. \r  \n\r  \n3) Cyber, Click-To-Pay, MA allows for your credit card details to be stored safely so that for subsequent transactions you can just conveniently bring up your details previously entered.\r  \n\r  \nGiven that the success of Value-added services and solutions is hinged on the success of MA\u2019s payment network, I forecasted it as a % of Payment Network, forecasting it as a % of historic averages.\n\n# Cost:\n\n\rMA has 3 different costs \u201cCOGS\u201d, \u201cMarketing\u201d, and \u201cOthers\u201d. COGS refers to G&A as MA relies on its workforce to produce its G&S.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting COGS, looking at the historic numbers of employees ([SOURCE](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MA/mastercard/number-of-employees#:~:text=Mastercard%20total%20number%20of%20employees,a%2014.29%25%20increase%20from%202020)). I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting cost per employee, I assumed that historic trends continue for 5 years before wages grow in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\r  \n\r  \nWhen forecasting Marketing and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\n# WACC:\n\nRFR (1M Avg) = 4.23%\r  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA/)) = 1.07\r  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60% \r  \nCOE = 9.15%\r  \n\r  \nMA bond is rated \u201cA+\u201d ([SOURCE](https://cbonds.com/news/2379935/))\r  \nCOD (1M Avg) = 5.38%\r  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%\r  \nAT-COD = 4.25%\r  \n\r  \nStock Price (5D Avg) = $471.19\r  \nShares O/S = 932.89M\r  \nMarket Value of Equity = 439569.15M\r  \nFY23 Interest Expense = 575.00M\r  \nAverage maturity of debt = 9 years\r  \nMarket Value of Debt = 15138.04M\r  \n%Debt = 3.34%\r  \n%Equity = 96.66%\r  \n%WACC = 8.99%\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value MA at $455.14 per share. I believe that the markets have correctly priced MA, seeing the value that MA could potentially bring to the consumers. News of the Credit Card Competition act has not eroded investor's confidence in the stock and what it brings. However, I believe that going forward MA has a strong potential to grow exponentially but also the potential to see their growth rate taper aggressively. This is hinged on how well MA can execute its growth strategy in critical areas like China and APMEA.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/3CORoHm)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/ggbwHu3)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/vV6wmH4)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/UbhugHF)\\]  \nRevenue Model (Part 1): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/lpCowYL)\\]  \nRevenue Model (Part 2): \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/Ycr32LM)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/IHarw8q)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/NZHVi0d)\\]\r  \n",

Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.\n\"The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,\" brokerage TD Cowen said.\n\n\"It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.\"\n\nNews of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.\nBrokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.\nThe prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to \"see the intentions of the next administration,\" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.\n\n\"If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.\"\n\nMastercard shares fell 1% in morning trade. Both stocks have underperformed broader markets this year, gaining 11% and 16.5% respectively, compared with the S&P 500's (.SPX), opens new tab near 20% gain.\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-falls-report-us-doj-lawsuit-alleging-debit-card-monopoly-2024-09-24/",

The drop was caused by two major factors:\r  \n\r  \n**1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.\r  \n\r  \n**2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.\r  \n\r  \nTesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.\r  \n\r  \nTesla shares have dropped roughly 22% in the last month, but are still **up 60% year to date.**\r  \n\r  \n",

Amid economic uncertainties, local shoppers have flocked to discounting platforms such as Alibaba rival Pinduoduo.\n\nThe Taobao and Tmall business, Alibaba\u2019s China e-commerce platforms, brought in revenue of 129.1 billion Chinese yuan in the December quarter, up just 2% year-on-year.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cloud computing business, which investors have seen as critical to the tech giant\u2019s future growth, brought in sales of 28.1 billion yuan, a 3% year-on-year rise.\n\nIn a statement, recently-appointed Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said the company\u2019s focus is on growth in e-commerce and cloud.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing.

This is brutal to me and seems all the dominance is priced in or just trading at an overvaluation. AXP trades at a 16 PE and around a 2 Price to Sales.\n\nAMEX is right there with MA as far as the market share and they issue their own cards unlike MA. I know they are dominant in their space and create a crazy amount of money but the valuation seems brutal. \n\nWhat is the overall thoughts on V and MA valuation as we stand today?",

This year, the composite bond market has lost -5.55%, which is also worst than 2009's loss of -5.16%.\n\nReferences\n\nBaltussen, G., Van Vliet, B. P., & Van Vliet, P.

They don\u2019t even pretend to disguise their brutality. For Christ\u2019s sake, they\u2019re genociding an entire group of people (Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China)!! Point is, if they want you gone, you\u2019re gone. I\u2019m not informed enough to cite specific examples, but haven\u2019t they disappeared billionaires before??

The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting -- released on Wednesday -- pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.\n\nAll this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs. \n\nThe Nasdaq Composite index is on pace for its biggest weekly decline since November, even as it rose in the New York afternoon trading session Thursday. A 3.3% fall Wednesday marked its worst single-day session since February last year.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/number-of-nasdaq-stocks-down-50-or-more-is-almost-at-a-record-1.1704111",

Why the contradiction? *NB: Yahoo and Wall Street have a stake in Alibaba?*\n\n*Google more using Chinese characters \u9a6c\u4e91 = Jack Ma = M\u01ce Y\u00fan (\u9a6c\u4e91)*\n\nKeypoint: Authority deliberately imposed many restrictions on labeling and what can be sold on Alibaba's Taobao on Nov 11... To understand this Commie strategy, read \"China tightens restrictions on Australian exports\" [https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537) ... same idea.\n\n2. You must have heard of \"China drafts new antitrust guideline to rein in tech giants\" by now. What's the big deal? US and the west did the same thing (to MSFT, GOOG) ... nothing happened.\n\nWell, you must have forgotten conviction rate in China is literally 99%. That's the difference.\n\n3. Ant Financials IPO - The politics behind the suspension isn't something Joe can understand.\n\nFirst, the timing - why IPO suspended on the eve of the debut? This is directly due to the 5th China Communist Party plenum that ended just before Jack Ma & co were told their $3 trillion Ant Financials IPO has been suspended.\n\nClue: No heir apparent as Xi Jinping reveals top leadership.\n\nStill wondering what's happening? Here > The Boss wanna make sure all parties are obsessed with the world's largest and sauciest IPO, happy, and create no trouble during the party plenum, which is the \"Bilderberg\" of China that may give birth to China's new leader (*against Xi Jinping who wanna rule forever*)\n\nSecond, non-bank money-lending is considered loan-sharking no matter how hard you try masqurade the sin as \"fintech\" -- no different from trying to bypass the Fed with any other form of money (just google what happened to those who tried...). This is not to say China is shutting down Ant Financials becos Jack Ma created a new currency, it's becos Ant's microlending is seen as a timebomb for CCP.\n\nHow so?\n\nGoogle keywords like \"China P2P Lending Suicide Scandal\", you'd see why did China cracked down the so called hitech \"P2P Lending\" industry that left behind nothing good except social ills like suicides, bankruptcies, etc (many still listed as pennystocks on NASDAQ like KXIN, WEI, etc. -- all were given 2 years to wind down and do something else)... Ant Financials is no difference for CCP believes Jack Ma & co. will leave behind the same mess so big that it may just collapse the CCP.\n\nYou see?\n\nPlus, big-mouthed Jack Ma actually told this guy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang\\_Qishan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Qishan) that China regulators are dinosaur that neither understand nor capable of regulating \"fintech\".\n\nTL;DR: Jack Ma is history -- He has been personally targeted to send out a clear message: \"Who's The Boss\" (just like why Trump fired Esper the other day). \"Xi Jinping going after Jack Ma's head\" [https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876](https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876)\n\n*What do you make up of the situation?*",

Curious what people think about this. Do you think there is an audience for this form of buying/selling?\n\ncopied directly from their site --\n\nInitial Public Offering seeks a direct listing approach to a featured, original painting created by the artist. 75% of the painting is available to the public which will be distributed through 9 shares. The painting has been divided into the 9 available shares through an unbiased algorithmic process. The price of each share, $25.63, has then been determined by the overall cost of materials to make the original work. The offering will be open until the clock runs out, which is set for two weeks. When the clock zeros, the featured painting will be severed into the pre-determined shares shown on the homepage.\n\n[https://initialpublicoffering.today/](https://initialpublicoffering.today/)",

At the moment I am mainly invested in tech stocks, simply because this is a market that I understand quite well.\n\nI'm looking to expand further into financial blue chips and my eye fell on the major credit card companies. All three tickers in the title seem to have consistent growth and dividends and just solid companies overall.\n\nNow one of the things that interests me most when choosing a specific ticker to invest in is its moat or edge in the market. I was therefore wondering what separates these companies and what makes it so they can thrive side by side in the current market.\n\nI know this question will probably sound naive if you are knowledgeable on these companies. I'm really, honestly looking for a starting point on understanding them better.\n\nAny advice and discussion is appreciated. Thanks.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday\u2019s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n> \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n> \u201cIf [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n> \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n> \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n> The S&P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n> Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n> First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak\n\n> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NIO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$FCEL** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$FDX** \n> * **$CRWD** \n> * **$HUYA** \n> * **$NBEV** \n> * **$BE** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$YY** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$MUX** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$TME** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$CVSI** \n> * **$ACRX** \n> * **$ACN** \n> * **$GES** \n> * **$WPRT** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$GIS**\n> * **$CPRX** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$DRI** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$ZTO** \n> * **$BAX** \n> * **$LEN** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$WSM** \n> * **$TCOM** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$REI** \n> * **$DBI** \n> * **$CTRA** \n> * **$GPL** \n> * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n> **NIO Inc.

With some FUD in the market right now due to a combination of Omicron, inflation concerns, overvaluation, tapering, etc., are there any stocks you\u2019re just waiting to fall so you can swoop in and buy them at a cheaper (and possibly fairer) price? I know I have a few\u2026\n\n1) ADBE: My lone non-purchase regret from when I started in April. I didn\u2019t know at the time just how big of a moat the company had, and when I found out, it was already in the 600s. Had a chance to buy during the September-October sell-off, but set my price level too low (wanted in under 500, but it never dipped under 550). If this thing dips back into the 500s, I\u2019m entering and DCAing down.\n\n2) HD/LOW: Didn\u2019t buy when I started because I saw the big climb on their charts, but these two chains basically have home improvement by the balls. Plus, they pay some handsome dividends. Ideally, I\u2019d love for HD to come back to 300, but that won\u2019t likely happen barring something catastrophic, so maybe the 350s is where I start building a position.\n\n3) GS: I panic sold this one during the last deep correction when I found out it had exposure to Evergrande, and while it was a profitable sell, it\u2019s since leaped back into the 400s. Likely won\u2019t get my original entry price of the 340s, but deep enough pullback will get my attention.\n\n4) ABBV: Had this ticker and panic sold it when it crashed hard that one morning back in September. Only made a few dollars when I was up over $100 at one point. It then started another slow run upward. If it comes back to my original price of 107, I\u2019m re-entering.\n\nYours?",

        "post_text": "Alibaba shares jump after it completes three-year regulatory overhaul  Alibaba has completed a three-year regulatory \u201crectification\u201d process following an antitrust fine it received on charges of monopolistic practices in 2021, China\u2019s market regulator said on Friday.\n\nShares of Alibaba rose more than 3% in Friday morning trading.\n\nOn Friday, China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said that, over the past few years, it has been supervising Alibaba\u2019s process to become compliant with antitrust regulations. The rectification work has achieved \u201cgood results,\u201d the SAMR said, according to a Google-translated statement.\n\nIn 2021, China\u2019s SAMR fined Alibaba 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) as part of an anti-monopoly investigation into the tech giant. The regulator\u2019s focus was on a practice that forces merchants to choose one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than being able to work with both.\n\nAt the time, the regulator said that the \u201cchoose one\u201d policy and others allowed Alibaba to bolster its position in the market and gain unfair competitive advantages.\n\nSince that fine, the SAMR has been supervising Alibaba as it gets in line with the regulator\u2019s requirements. Alibaba has now completed this process and has stopped the \u201d\u2018choose one of two\u2019 monopoly behavior,\u201d the SAMR said Friday.\n\nThe SAMR said it will now guide Alibaba to continue to improve its compliance and efficiency and to accelerate innovation.\n\nThe conclusion of the regulatory overhaul will help put one of Alibaba\u2019s worst run-ins with Beijing behind it. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Friday that the conclusion of the regulatory process was a \u201cpositive\u201d for the company, which \u201chighlights this is a new start and ensures compliance in operations.\u201d\n\nBut the regulator\u2019s announcement could also signal the ongoing softening stance from Chinese regulators towards private technology firms, following an intense crackdown that began at the end of 2020. At the time, Beijing enacted several regulations and moves that aimed to restrict the power of domestic technology firms in areas ranging from antitrust to gaming.\n\nThe empire of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been in the spotlight over the past few years since regulators axed the IPO of his financial technology firm Ant Group in 2020. Ant Group itself also underwent a regulator-supervised rectification process, with most of the major issues resolved by last year.\n\nRegulatory concerns have been an overhang on the Alibaba stock, which has fallen more than 70% from its peak in 2020. More recently, the company has been dealing with slow growth amid rising competition in the e-commerce space in China, as well as contending with a cautious Chinese consumer.\n\nThe tech titan showed early signs of a recovery in the June quarter, as cloud computing revenue reaccelerated and transactions via its e-commerce platforms looked healthy.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/alibaba-shares-jump-as-it-completes-three-year-regulatory-overhau.html",

Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.\n\nIt\u2019s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It\u2019s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla\u2019s own CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly four times International Business Machines \ufffc\u2019 (IBM) market cap.\n\nYou could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store\u2014or just buy Dollar General \ufffc (DG) and Dollar Tree \ufffc (DLTR).\n\nIt\u2019s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.\n\nWith $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA\u2019s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.\n\nIf you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla\u2019s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nThanks for the awards.",

Buy quality stocks and if you don't know what to buy like 95% of us myself included, buy ETFs like VOO/QQQ/etc... and ignore the rest! \n\ntl:dr Don't worry about it, DCA and ignore the market and move on!  Your 10 year from now self with thankyoU!",

I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  \n\nI'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's \"this close\" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  \n\nThe first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  \n\nMy primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:\n\n**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG\n\n**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT\n\nThat was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\\*Mart)...  \n\nI'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post_text": "Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis # Introduction:\n\nGood morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.\n\nAnyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.\n\nThere will be a few questions we are looking to answer:\n\n1. Is there revenue growth?\n2. Is there earnings growth?\n3. Is the company really leveraged?\n4. Is there strong cash flow?\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.\n\n# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:\n\nJohnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is the world\u2019s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:\n\n* pharmaceutical,\n* medical devices and diagnostics,\n* consumer good/discretionary\n\nThe pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \\~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:\n\n* immunology,\n* oncology,\n* neurology,\n* pulmonary,\n* cardiology,\n* metabolic diseases.\n\nThe device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women\u2019s health.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n>\\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  \n>  \n>\\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  \n>  \n>\\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  \n>  \n>\\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n>\\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company\u2019s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  \n>  \n>\\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  \n>  \n>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)\n\n# Financial History:\n\nOne thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.\n\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|\n|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|\n|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|\n|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|\n|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|\n\nThe revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).\n\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|\n|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|\n|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|\n\nIncreases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \\~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.\n\nSo ...\n\n1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes\n2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes\n3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt\n4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes\n\n# Some other numbers:\n\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\n\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|\n|:-|:-|\n|Yield|2.76%|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|\n\nFrom a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.\n\nLet's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)\n\n|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|\n\nDelicious.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nFrom a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Additionally, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.\n\nThere are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Furthermore the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.\n\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!\n\nEDIT: For those than cannot find the poll and are interested, [It can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/jxs9uy/which_of_the_following_would_you_like_to_see_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

I like high protection against \u2018prevented deaths and hospitalizations\u2019. I like potential up-swing with vaccine approval. Don\u2019t like lower overall effective % vs competitors. Don\u2019t like rumored production limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, I hope everyone out there is staying safe during these crazy times. I\u2019ve been learning a lot from being a lurker on here these past few months of quarantine/semi-quarantine life.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the point. I\u2019m BULLISH on Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ). A bluechip, long-standing American-based company founded in 1886, no.37 on F500, huge portfolio, nice dividends - shit ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere. \n\nIn my opinion, JNJ\u2019s upcoming vaccine will be a big step in the battle against COVID worldwide. I believe it has a lot of upside versus its competitors. JNJ has a large pool of resources and plenty of support from the Biden administration.\n\nJNJ\u2019s vaccine is currently awaiting emergency authorization approval (hopefully by the end of the month), but everything seems to be looking good and vaccines are already being produced with partner $EBS. JNJ\u2019s vaccine has a lot of advantages in the production/logistics dept., which is currently a problem for other vaccines. Things things I like:\n\n-Vaccine takes only 60-70 days to produce (Pfizer is 110 days)\n\n-JNJ vaccine can stay in STANDARD FRIDGE temperatures for 3 MONTHS (compared to sub-zero vaccines)\n\n-JNJ says 100m vaccines by this summer, probably making millions/billions more in foreseeable future (rumored production limitations)\n\n-SINGLE DOSE, easy logistics\n\n-More effective versus variants\n\n-65% effective overall but 85% EFFECTIVE PREVENT SEVERE CASES\n\n-Worldwide demand\n\n-JNJ taking same technology for vaccines/trials fighting against Ebola/HIV/Zika/more\n\n$JNJ and a lot of the healthcare industry are currently trending upward. I\u2019m hoping it runs up short-term with vaccine approval later this month. Long-term BULL attitude as well, taking COVID vaccine tech and fighting other diseases. Safe investment, good dividends, potential short-to-mid term upside. \n\nThere is also a lot of MSM support with strong projections:\n\nhttps://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=JNJ#:~:text=The%2016%20analysts%20offering%2012,the%20last%20price%20of%20166.79.\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/johnson-johnson/jnj/\n\n\nThis is purely speculation. I am an idiot. I just want us all to be safe, happy and make tendies. \n\nCurrently poor-ish and in for 10 @ 163. Hopefully buying more. \n\n\n\n\nOther sources:\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-factory/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html\n\nhttps://news.northeastern.edu/2021/02/11/heres-how-the-johnson-johnson-vaccine-compares-to-others/",

        "post_text": "All you need to know about JNJ\u2019s vaccine While you were debating blueberry smoothie vs. greasy b/e/c on Saturday, the FDA authorized Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine for emergency use. \n\nGame = changed. The federal government expects to distribute 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine by the end of June, starting with 4 million this week. On top of the doses provided by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, that means a vaccine will be available to every American adult who wants one by the end of July. \n\nJ&J\u2019s vaccine is only one dose and can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, so it\u2019s ideal for use at drive-thru vaccination sites and with \u201ctransient population groups,\u201d such as those on college campuses. \nIt\u2019s the Covid era, so you know there\u2019s a \u201cbut.\u201d The US is still dealing with new Covid-19 variants, particularly B1351, and the decline in case numbers looks like it\u2019s plateaued. Plus, the J&J vaccine\u2019s effectiveness rate is a bit lower than the other two, so public health authorities are worried about people dismissing it as a second-rate option. \n\nBottom line: The vaccine works really well and health leaders encourage everyone who\u2019s eligible to get it. \n\n[source: Morning Brew](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/23074411.1032382/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ybmluZ2JyZXcuY29tL2RhaWx5L3IvP2tpZD01MzNmYzI5ZQ/5cbe3beb24c17c6c936b328eBf735a4c5)",

Since JNJ is a company similar in size and structure to Pfizer I  think a \\~10% increase can be achievable here in the next two weeks. So I  bought some today at 160$ and I hope I can sell some at \\~172$ at some  point during the next two weeks.

        "post_text": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Breakdown Wanted to change these posts a little in order to incorporate a greater amount of information without it being too overloaded. The post might be a little longer than previous, but gives a better overview of the company imo.\n\n**Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)**\n\nJohnson & Johnson is a multinational healthcare conglomerate that is known for producing pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and healthcare products such as baby care, the skin care product line Neutrogena, and over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol. Although they've recently been making [headlines](https://www.cancerhealth.com/article/johnson-johnson-ends-north-american-sales-talcbased-baby-powder) for the wrong reasons due to their talc-based baby powder, their massive reach into all major areas of healthcare make them a flagship of the sector and a smart choice for any investor's portfolio.\n\nThe company is divided into 3 main segments:\n\n- Consumer Healthcare - baby care, skin & hair care, wound care & topicals, OTC medicines\n- Medical Devices - diabetes care & insulin delivery, various surgery related devices, orthopedics\n- Pharmaceuticals - drugs for immunology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and oncology \n\n**JNJ Financials Breakdown**\n\n- Consumer Healthcare - $13.9B = 17% of total sales (+0.3% vs 2018)\n- Medical Devices - $26B = 32% of total sales (-3.8% vs 2018)\n- Pharmaceuticals - $42.2B = 51% of total sales (+3.6% vs 2018)\n\nNet Sales: $82.1B; $42B U.S. sales, $40B International sales\n\nResearch & Development Expenses: $11.3B total, a 5.4% increase over 2018; Consumer Healthcare: $493M, Medical Devices: $2B, Pharmaceuticals: $8.8B\n\nNet Earnings: $15.1B in 2019; $15.3B in 2018\n\nNet Assets: $157.7B with $17.3B in cash & cash equivalents\n\nLiabilities: $98.3B in total liabilities with $26.5B in long term debt\n\n[Data from 2019 10-K](https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/ffd0ad42-ac56-4fd4-8fc2-b033c4ed62c6)\n\n**Other Information**\n\nJNJ is one of only 2 companies rated by S&P as having AAA credit. (Microsoft is the other) [More information on S&P credit ratings can be found here](https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352)\n\nJNJ is a dividend king (50+ consecutive years of increasing dividends) with a current streak of 57 years. It is one of only 28 companies to be included on this prestigious list. The stock's current yield is 2.79%. [A good resource on Dividend Kings from one of my favorite sites can be found here](https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-kings/)\n\nJNJ operates in more than 60 countries with 134,000 employees and more than 250 subsidiary companies.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nJohnson & Johnson is one of the largest companies in the world with an impressive portfolio of healthcare products. $40B in international sales and operations in over 60 countries gives them an enormous economic moat and access to markets all over the world. Their sales numbers are solid, and have increased in each of the last 5 years. Earnings dropped slightly compared to 2018 but their R&D expenses increased, indicating they are dedicated to innovation and developing additional new healthcare products. The current pandemic and economic turmoil shouldn't significantly affect their short term financials, and long term they are well positioned for continued success.\n\nDespite their controversies over the years, I think JNJ is a great choice for any investor looking for a long term buy-and-hold healthcare stock. Even after sales in baby care products declined by 10% in 2019, their Consumer Healthcare segment still finished the year with a net increase in sales of 0.3%. While this is due to the massive array of other products they sell, it also highlights how one area of business under-performing doesn't drag the entire company down. The stock isn't a fast mover, but being up 44% over the last 5 years is still respectable growth. With a dividend yield of 2.79% and solid cash flow they have plenty of room to grow their dividend over time as well.",

        "post_text": "Help with PLUG and JNJ Hey! This might be random, but I'd love to see the feedback I get. I use a very small brokerage account as an \"Emergency Fund/Explore the Market\" account. I started with just under $1,000 as per Dave Ramsey's initial emergency fund/baby step. I couldn't stand just letting the money sit in a shit savings account, so I invested it in some \"basics,\" like Apple, Disney, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson. I've now also got some VTI, some Zoom, and some Plug, among a few others. My overall strategy is buy and hold, but I do want to make sure I'm not missing massive opportunities to sell. What I reinvest in when I sell is where I get lost. But it's so hard to not sell Plug right now. How do I make these decisions, especially if this is mostly for fun/preservation of capital? I'm surprisingly risk averse, though I'd be filthy rich had I poured more initial capital into this thing 5 years ago (we probably all say that at times).\n\nBest example is PLUG, which I'm up 922% on. The equity is fairly low, but it now makes up 35% of my portfolio. Entire portfolio is up nearly 220% all time. Most of my Plug shares were purchased at $3.00, some closer to $10. Anyway...just wanted to throw it out there and get any advice. Buy and hold is my main approach, but I obviously get antsy at times and wonder what I'm waiting for to start making some basic moves. All I've really done in the past few years is get rid of XBI cuz it was doing nothing and get out of Disney b/c it was just too boring.\n\nNot looking to day trade or get into options, but is there something smarter I could be doing?",

While bigger companies like JNJ, Pfizer doesn't gain much out of this situation? I'm not familiar with biotech industry and only start tracking recently.\n\nLook at SPEX and INO and a few other company, their shares can gain over 100% on a good news and immediately drops to around previous level, if investors are buying good news, why the stock plummet right after? Any speculations who will be the next?\n\nAlso is it still good time to invest in JNJ, Pfizer? Even though they also play a big role in this COVID-19 situation, their stock price more or less follows the index itself rather than consistently outperform the index?\n\nModerna seems a solid pick over above 2, any other recommendations on who will benefit mid-term?

I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.\n\nHowever the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.\n\nThe issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?\n\nI have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.\n\nIf you yourself know of companies within the healthcare sector who has a moat I'd love to hear it. Or if there's any healthcare company you have in your portfolio let me know. I'll be doing my own valuation & analysis but suggestions are more than welcomed.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.\n*****\n> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.\n*****\n> \u201cMost of the slowdown occurred in March,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cDo we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You\u2019re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n> \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n> \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n> \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives?

That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n> \u201cA positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders\n\n> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$RAD** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$BBBY** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$CBSH** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$AMRN** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$LAKE** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$LOVE** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$KEY** \n> * **$SON** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$BLX** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$MUSA** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$BMI** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$SRC** \n> * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $102.76\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Their best selling drug, Remicade (infliximab), accounted for approximately 8.3% of the Company\u2019s total net trade sales for fiscal 2017. Problem is, this drug\u2019s patent has already expired everywhere but in the U.S and that patent is coming to an end in September 2018. To make matters worse, the patent has also been held invalid by the Federal District Court in the District of Massachusetts. Anyone want to chime in on this? Maybe I\u2019m missing something but this looks terrible for the company.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that the company still relies heavily on their trademarked products and is currently marketing 4 more immunology drugs. However, this still doesn\u2019t make up for the 8.3% from Remicade.",

Have been successfully trading stocks for the past 8 years now and looking to share and consume valuable information here.\n\nThe first stock I will analyse is Johnson & Johnson - which in my view is a pharmaceutical plus! Apart from medicine this company also produces interesting consumer products focused on health and personal care. A few of their famous brands are: Band-Aid, Compeed, Listerine and Acavue. About 3/4 of their revenue consists of pharmaceutical products and medical aids.\n\nIt is a bit of a boring company, but it has a great management. Their return on equity has been above 25%(!) for years now. Their balance sheet is strong and they are a true dividend champion. They have had a rising dividend for the past 50 years and it is currently at around 3 dollars a share. On top of that the management has a nose for good acquisitions with which it adds to their already impressive line of products.\n\nThe last few years they have had a lot less trouble with expiring patents compared to Pfizer, one of their biggest competitors. For the years to come there are no patent expirations for important products. On top of that they have a bunch of interesting medicine in the pipeline, ready to enter the markets. A lot of those have their heritage in biotechnology which makes them a lot harder to counterfeit. A great example of this is the medicine Xarelto, a blood thinner they developed in cooperation with the German company Bayer.\n\nThe organic growth of the pharmaceutical part of the company is predicted to be around 6-7% in the years to come. In particular Xarelto, Invokana (diabetes medication) and Imbruvica (cancer medicine) are expected to be pulling the cart. The consumer products division might be affected by the strong dollar, but for European investors this should not be a problem. At the current price of $132 a share, Johnson & Johnson is not expensive at a price/earnings ratio of 14.5 for 2019.\n\nTell me what you guys think!",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n> But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n> \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n> \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n> \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n> \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n> \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n> \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # News High for Net New Highs\n\n> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Breadth Booming\n\n> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n> October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # JPMorgan Chase & Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Why can't anyone over 40 who develops mesothelioma (there are 3000 new cases every year) just claim they got it using baby powder in the 70s??\n\nIn addition to those judgements, there also appears to be risk in being held partially responsible for the opioid epidemic (they're already facing lawsuits from a few states.)

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 14, 2020. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 14, 2020**\n\nStocks accelerated yesterday\u2019s losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.\n\nToday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be \u201cdifficult\u201d before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson called \u201cproductive\u201d. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. \n\nThe impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said \u201cWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.\u201d The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting \u201cGo big or go home!!!\u201d for more stimulus. \n\nIn other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\nIn terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that \u201cJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans \u2014 $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) reported third-quarter results that greatly exceeded expectations. The stock was marginally green at the time of writing, pulled down by the broader market.\n   * EPS of  $9.68 vs $5.37 estimate \n   * Revenue of $10.70 billion vs $9.40 billion\n* Bank of America (BAC) barely outperformed earnings estimates. The stock took a hit and was 4.25% down at the time of writing. \n   * EPS of $0.51 vs $0.43\n   * Revenue of $20.30 billion vs $20.88 billion estimate\n* Wells Fargo (WFC) slightly beat earnings. The stock also took a big hit today, 5.27% down at the time of writing. \n   * EPS of $18.86 billion vs $17.87 billion.\n* Amazon (AMZN) has struck a deal with the NFL to stream a playoff game this season, people familiar with the matter said. \n* Since Sept. 23, the Russell 2000 has risen nearly 13%, outperforming the S&P 500 by 4 percentage points. The small-cap benchmark is now approaching its year to date high of 1705.2, set in January, and is only 100-odd points below the record it reached in 2018.\n* Intel Corporation (INTC) had price target raised by UBS from $64 to $67\n* Livongo (LVGO) had its price target raised by JPMorgan (JPM) from $88 to $150\n* NIO was upgraded by JPMorgan Chase from NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT with $40 price target.

Those two findings included deleted data on the company's manufacturing processes and failed quality control over audit paper trails, sources told Reuters.\n* Notable Performers today: NIO 21.6% up, XPEV 14.2% up, BBBY 8.4% up, JKS 8.3% up, GRUB 8.1% up, HYLN 8.1% up, LI 7.8% up, BIDU 7.47% up.\n\n\"Live a great life where you are, and in the daily work you have to do, and greater works will surely find you out.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 1 , 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 1, 2021**\n\nStocks staged a remarkable rally Monday as the market celebrated another effective coronavirus vaccine and Treasury yields stabilized. Each of the major indexes gained more than 2% today after suffering one of the worst weeks since October. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.\n\nIn Washington DC, over the weekend, the House of Representatives advanced the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package without any Republican support. The bill includes an additional payment of $1,400 to Americans, $400 per week in augmented Federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in State, local, and tribal aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, with lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before the mid-March deadline when current Federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. \n\nThe Democrats are employing a process called reconciliation in order to get the stimulus bill passed without Republican support. Through reconciliation, Congress can enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. As a reminder, there is a 50/50 split in the Senate, but Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Vice-President, has the power to break a tie. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NIO is set to report earnings after the bell, this is one we are closely watching\n* Two new space stocks, Spire Global and Vector are set to join the market via merger. Space stocks have been very hot recently and Cathie Woods of ARK Investments is planning to release a space-themed ETF soon.\n* Construction spending increased by 1.7% to $1.521 trillion, according to the Commerce Department's monthly report for January, with that level marking the greatest since the start of the government series in 2002. \n* After pulling back along with the broader market, Bitcoin (BTC) went from low $43,000 to over $48,000 now. \n* Facebook (FB) signed up a string of German media partners on Monday to provide content for a local news product, but the publisher of the country's best-selling newspaper said it would not take part on terms it dismissed as derisory. After the recent situation in Australia, Facebook now has to sign new publishers for its platform.\n* Nio is planning to start exporting to Europe in the second half of 2021, CEO William Li said during a web conference, [cnEV Post ](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)reported, citing automotive media outlet Bitauto.com.\n* Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) target raised by Barclays from $113 to $140 at Overweight.

I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.\n\nMy main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I\u2019ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don\u2019t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:\n\n- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN\n\nWhen choosing stocks I didn\u2019t really look through the financial sheets.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.\n\nLast week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as \u201ctransitory\u201d and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.\n* \u201cMeme stocks\u201d continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!\n* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84\n* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $522 at Buy. Stock currently around $412\n* UPS target raised by Citigroup from $220 to $235 at Neutral. Stock currently around $215\n* The Gap (GPS) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $38 at Hold. Stock currently around $33.4\n\n\u201cSomeone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a **tree** a long time ago.\u201d - Warren Buffet",

        "post_text": "Good companies you bought too high We all know that, by choosing our own stocks, we\u2019re bound to make some of these mistakes. We research the company, we know they\u2019re profitable and stable, but we end up paying too much for their stock. Which companies in your portfolio are you holding that you entered at too high of a price? I\u2019ll start\u2026\n\n1) MMM - I grabbed 10 shares at around 178 after it came down from 200 alongside AMGN and JNJ. Of the three purchased at the time, only MMM hasn\u2019t printed. It\u2019s a \u201cforever\u201d hold for me, but man, why did I think the high 170s was a decent price?\n\n2) DIS - Bought on my first day in the market back in April of 2021. I had no clue how to value stocks at the time, and I grabbed them at 187. It\u2019s only returned to that price once since then (August earnings beat), but otherwise it\u2019s a permanent red mark.\n\n3) INTC - Same as Disney. Day one purchase, just happened to buy when it was at 67. Have since added more at 47 to bring my average down, but wow, why the rush to buy?\n\n4) CI - Not a day one buy, but I bought based on its up trending chart, hoping to continue riding the wave. Little did I know my 259 entry would be near the top of the wave, because CI since then dipped as far down as the high 190s.\n\n5) RIO - Lured in by its dividends, I happened to buy at 90 when commodity prices were near their peak. It climbed to 97 before quickly tumbling into the 60s. It\u2019s climbing again though, but I need to sell it and buy back in when commodities drop again.\n\nYours?",

        "post_text": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "post_text": "I went through the biggest 1,500 stocks by size one by one and picked out the 248 best. Here's the list: # LINKS AT BOTTOM\n\nThis is not a holy grail list, nor investment advice. It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 \"most consistent\", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the \"most consistent\" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for \"cheap\".\n\n# ***METHODOLOGY:\n\n1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to; ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias.\n2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later.\n3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y.\n4. The financial metrics I am analyzing; Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.\n   1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time.\n5. Now, the analysis;\n   1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.\n   2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.\n      1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+\n      2. Current & Quick Ratio >1\n      3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.\n      4. And an overall high R\\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each.\n6. Growth Adjustments:\n   1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \\*could\\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.\n   2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend.\n7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:\n   1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:\n      1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)\n      2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)\n      3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)\n      4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential\n   2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=\u222b\u2080^(y)  (g + 1)\\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is \"Years to full IRR\". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw)\n8. FOR THE \"MOST CONSISTENT\" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs; there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \\~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\\*\\*\\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it\u2019s possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock\n\nEdit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements. Interestingly enough, it's almost exactly the 2 STDEV percentile aka. 95% percentile.\n\nEDIT: PART 2; link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)\n\nI'll get straight to the point; I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly.

I\u2019m somewhat new to trading so I\u2019m being conservative by just selling covered calls or cash puts. \n\nTotal gain today (and likely for the week) was 704.82\n\nOverall I\u2019ve made 7851.91 since 21 June and I thought I\u2019d start sharing what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s modest gain but it\u2019s something. \n\n $NVDA CC, 2 contracts, premium 2.11 a share , strike of 124 expiring 7/26. I may end up rolling this as I\u2019m long at 118.91 and I love that low avg price. \n\n$GME CC, 3 contracts, premium .41 a share, strike at 29 expiring 7/26. I have an additional 24 contracts from last week expiring this week as well that I rolled for about 2k. \n\n$DJT CC, 1 contract, premium 1.60 a share, strike 36, expiring 7/26.\n\n I stupidly sold cash puts on this immediately after the assassination attempt. The fundamentals are terrible, I\u2019m just in it for the pump and dump. Just after the assassination attempt there was a pop on the 24 hour market, another pop in premarket, and at market open. I expected the same with Biden dropping out and while there was a surge on the 24 hour market, it failed to maintain those levels premarket and at the opening bell. I\u2019ll be selling these just as soon as I can. \n\n$AVGO cash puts is kinda hurting me. 1 contract from last week with a strike of 158.5. I don\u2019t think it will come back down to that level by end of week and I\u2019ve tied up 16k that I could use to just buy the stock. It has an avg price projected price in one year at 192 on Fintel, with the price at 160 right now it's basically got a bigger upside potential than $NVDA. $NVDA is sitting at 123 with a projected 1 year avg of 132. Thinking between a 5:1 or 3:2 investment ratio $AVGO to $NVDA.\n\nFinally $PFE.  I bought 30 calls, .55 a share premium, at a strike of 31 expiring 8/30. $PFE just spent 2.54 million on lobbying (info from quiverquant.com). They have earnings coming up on 7/30 premarket and there\u2019s been breakthrough in glp-1 medication in pill form. Covid vaccinations will be on-going revenue and they\u2019ve had positive earning several quarters in a row. My breakeven price is 31.55, so in retrospect I should have spent more money on a lower strike price, as there is significant resistance at 30. \n\nThis is my first true options play. \n\nNFA and happy hunting \ud83d\udc02 \n\n",

People need to understand drugs and vaccines are a global business not just the US. Europe, South America and Asia have their own FDA and approve US drugs and vaccines.\n\nThird, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too. RFK will focus on fruit loops and the FDA will focus on pharma and their business because, he doesn't have a medical degree and will quickly realize he's out of his element.\n\nThe whole sector is way oversold due to fear. Same fear that tariffs will destroy the economy.\n\nI have $PFE leaps for $25 because this stock is way too cheap for what the business is worth. You also get a 6% yield with PFE.

Twelve receive a 10 microgram dose, 12 a 30 \u03bcg dose, 12 a 100 \u03bcg dose, and nine a placebo. The 100 \u03bcg dose caused fevers in half of patients; a second dose was not given at that level.\n\nFollowing a second injection three weeks later of the other doses, 8.3% of the participants in the 10 \u03bcg group and 75% of those in the 30 \u03bcg group developed fevers. More than 50% of the patients who received one of those doses reported some kind of adverse event, including fever and sleep disturbances. None of these side effects was deemed serious, meaning they did not result in hospitalization or disability and were not life-threatening.\n\nGood writeup here:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-shows-positive-results-report-says.html",

Now I hate that this has been going down just like everyone else. Except the shorts but that is the way it is. Now volume is pretty even now and it does not seem logical that the company stock is moving down when they have the number one med out for this virus prevent. Logic would suggest other wise.

I don't think this is priced in yet.\n\n**The Trade:**\n\nBuy long dated calls. PFE volatility is super low and calls are cheap AF. I bought 50 delta September calls for \\~$200.\n\n**Now expanding on this:**\n\n\\- Yes PFE stock price shot up and back down in December, bc of the news of FDA approval. People got scared out of their positions and the price dropped way wayyy back down, and its at a solid support to buy from right now.  high upside, low downside at this point.\n\n\\- The operational costs, and research & development costs were priced in last year, (for the most part). This is why they had low earnings last year. They had the upfront operational costs for the vaccine, but they had no actual revenue yet, bc the vaccine had not been distributed.\n\n\\- Expected 2 billion doses to deliver by end of 2021, but may change if additional contracts are signed. So there is even more potential revenue growth. The revenue growth will probably peak in 2021 and taper off in 2022. However, the view of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla is, \" I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting now.\"\n\n\\- There is a ton of negative attention on PFE stock right now. It seems to be nothing to do with the fundamentals, but just the fact that the stock is boring and not moving. But there has been the idea floating around that the covid vaccine isnt a money maker. I actually thought this myself before i started to research it.  Here is some of the ridiculous negative comments [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnowlf/why_did_game_changing_vaccine_stocks_like_pfe/)\n\n\\- Diving a little deeper into the trade idea. Buying calls is a brilliant play and credit goes to an article I read by Trevor Soare. PFE is sitting at a historic lows of implied volatility (IV). This means calls are cheap. Next earnings will be in 2 months, so there will be an increase in volatility up until that point. So my calls will gain value even if the stock price doesnt move. This will also provide some cushing even if the stock price does go down.\n\n\\- [Detriot mayor reject Jnj Vaccine saying Phizer and Moderna are \"the best\"](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/detroit-mayor-rejects-initial-jj-vaccine-shipment-saying-pfizer-and-moderna-are-the-best.html)\n\n\\- Micheal Burry has 15% in long calls on PFE. However noteworthy, Warren Buffet did exit his PFE position last year.\n\nThis is not financial advice, I have only put 3 days into this research. Keep that in mind. Want some people to poke holes in this and see if I am missing something.",

        "post_text": "Hedge-fund investor who made $2.6 billion on pandemic trades says omicron could be bullish for stock market Hedge-fund luminary Bill Ackman over the weekend said the new omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 could be bullish for stocks if it proves to result in mild to moderate symptoms for those who contract it. The discovery of the variant resulted in one of the worst Black Friday trading sessions in recent memory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.98%, the S&P 500 index SPX, 1.62% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 2.08% all tumbling by at least 2%, but Ackman\u2019s comments suggest that investors\u2019 knee-jerk response may have been an overreaction.\n\nBond yields on Friday also fell as prices for government debt saw a rush to the perceived safety of Treasurys on the back of fresh concerns about new restrictions that could result from a strain of COVID that the World Health Organization on Friday designated a variant of concern. However, stocks were bouncing back on Monday and the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.528% was up 8 basis points at 1.56%. Prices for Treasurys fall as yields rise. \n\nAckman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is known for his lucrative COVID wager. The Financial Times reported back in 2020 that the investor cashed out on bet that netted him a $2.6 billion profit on a $27 million at risk, on the premise that insurance premiums would soar during the height of the 2020 COVID pandemic as economies locked down. He also later in 2020 said that he placed bearish bets on corporate credit on the day that Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  and BioNTech BNTX, 3.65% released positive trial data on their COVID-19 vaccine, which triggered a whipsaw rally in stocks.\n\nAckman was wagering that the vaccines would lead to mask-wearing complacency. However, that bet presumably turned out wrong as markets continued to surge in the aftermath of those vaccines. The danger posed by the omicron variant isn\u2019t yet fully understood, even though governments in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas immediately restricted travel from southern Africa. Vaccine manufacturers have said that they are examining the variant closely and note that the current batch of remedies might still prove effective against the strain and new vaccines could be readied in early 2022 if needed.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-investor-who-made-2-6-billion-on-pandemic-trades-says-omicron-could-be-bullish-for-stock-market-11638198173?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-investor-who-made-2-6-billion-on-pandemic-trades-says-omicron-could-be-bullish-for-stock-market-11638198173?mod=home-page)",

Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss\n\n> * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.\n\n> * B/itcoin \u2014 which topped $52,000 this week \u2014 hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a \u201chighly speculative asset.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus\n\n> * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,\u201d she said.\u201d We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.\u201d Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid\n\n> * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.\n\n> * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer\u2019s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK\u2019s top court rules drivers are workers\n\n> * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company\u2019s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an \u201cagency\u201d that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, not employees.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice\n\n> * During Thursday\u2019s GameStop hearing, Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. \u201cI do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,\u201d Griffin added.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nxHmaP5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GIRwl9k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VbE1lLY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gGk8pg5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8AYKTCG.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yYi6DTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BRv9eiQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1SY4cN7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nYlYObU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jBrK42f/divical1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-deere-dropbox-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Deere (DE)** \u2013 The heavy equipment maker earned $3.87 per share for its fiscal first quarter, compared to a consensus estimate of $2.14 a share.

Any ticker symbols in particular that you have loaded up from these recent dips?\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\nI am hoping that NVDA continues its growth next year as its online services and the metaverse gain traction. AMD too obviously from their recent partnership with Tesla and Meta. Both of these companies had an amazing year that I believe will continue their growth for the next few years at least.\n\nSoFi and IONQ are also two stocks that I believe will be good bets for 2022, especially as the BC gets approved for SoFi. IONQ has strong fundaments and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nIm also DCAing into Paypal, as I believe that it just got hammered this year.

        "post_text": "$HGEN - short term COVID play with Phase 3 data release by end of march and 5-10x possible ROI Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \\*\\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab\n\n**What is it?**\n\nLenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered\u00ae anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID \u2013 patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nGM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don\u2019t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here\u2019s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What\u2019s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn\u2019t target the virus \u2013 it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\\\#variantagnostic)\n\nFrom the article: \u201cGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.\u201d\u2026  \u201cOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)\n\nFrom the article: \"Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM\u2010CSF might be a key feature of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010induced cytokine storm in COVID\u201019 patients\"\n\n**Does it work?**\n\nWe will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I\u2019ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more\n\n1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \\--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)\n2. An interim analysis of HGEN\u2019s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results \u2013 with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).\n3. Otilimab \u2013 a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF \u2013 recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab\u2019s chance of success\n4. Here\u2019s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \\[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\\]:  \u201cAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement\u201d\n5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)\n\nFunded and selected by the NIH \u2013 this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab\u2019s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial\n\n**Competition**\n\n\\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It\u2019s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted\n\n**COVID \u2013 getting worse**\n\nAs many of you might\u2019ve heard, COVID isn\u2019t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it\u2019s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.\n\nHow deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it\u2019s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here\u2019s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x\n\nGoogle cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here\u2019s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab\n\n**Partnerships**\n\n1.

Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \\[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\\]\n\n**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**\n\n**The Market**\n\nHere\u2019s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:\n\n1. Stockpiling \u2013 US and ex-US\n2. US market\n3. Outside the US market\n\nUS market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking\n\nOutside the US market:\n\n1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe\n2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))\n\n**Price forecasting:**\n\nConservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn\u2019t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.\n\nWith positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN\u2019s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.\n\n**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**\n\n$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock\u2019s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships\n\n**BONUS BONUS \u2013 CAR-T implications and more**\n\nLenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don\u2019t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID\n\n**Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don\u2019t want to downplay this, I think it\u2019s very promising and I\u2019m very bullish on it, but I\u2019m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There\u2019s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well. \n\nLenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.\n\n$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1\n\n**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**\n\nImo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.\n\nPOSITION: 1250 @ $16.30",

        "post_text": "CVS posts big earnings miss, cuts profit outlook on higher medical costs  CVS Health on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that missed expectations and slashed its full-year profit outlook, citing higher medical costs that are dogging the U.S. insurance industry.\n\nShares of the company dropped 10% in premarket trading.\n\nThe drugstore chain expects 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 per share, down from a previous guidance of at least $8.30 per share. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting full-year adjusted profit of $8.28 per share. \n\nCVS also cut its unadjusted earnings guidance to at least $5.64 per share, down from at least $7.06 per share. \n\nThe company said its new outlook assumes that higher medical costs in its insurance business during the first quarter will persist throughout the year. CVS owns health insurer Aetna. \n\nStill, CVS CEO Karen Lynch said in a statement that the \u201cthe current environment does not diminish our opportunities, enthusiasm, or the long-term earnings power of our company.\u201d The company is confident \u201cwe have a pathway to address our near-term Medicare Advantage challenges,\u201d she added.\n\nInsurers such as Humana and UnitedHealth Group have seen medical costs spike as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. \n\nMedicare Advantage, a privately run health insurance plan contracted by Medicare, has long been a key source of growth and profits for the insurance industry. But investors have become more concerned about the runaway costs associated with those plans, which cover more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries. \n\nHere\u2019s what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: \n\nEarnings per share: $1.31 adjusted vs. $1.69 expected\n\nRevenue: $88.44 billion vs. $89.21 billion expected\n\nCVS reported net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.14 billion, or $1.65 per share, for the same period a year ago. \n\nExcluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets and capital losses, adjusted earnings per share were $1.31 for the quarter.\n\nCVS booked sales of $88.44 billion for the quarter, up nearly 4% from the year-earlier period. That increase was driven by its pharmacy business and insurance unit. \n\nMeanwhile, CVS said sales in its health services segment, which includes the pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, declined during the period. That was mainly due to the loss of a large unnamed client, the company noted. \n\nIn January, Tyson Foods said it had dropped CVS\u2019s Caremark and instead chose PBM startup Rightway to manage drug benefits for its 140,000 employees starting this year. That came months after Blue Shield of California, one of the largest in the nation\u2019s most populous state, also dropped Caremark and instead partnered with Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cuban\u2019s Cost Plus Drugs company. \n\nThose decisions add to an upheaval in the health-care industry, as startups promising lower costs and transparency challenge the largest PBMs and pressure them to change their own business models. \n\nThe first-quarter results come as CVS pushes to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company. CVS deepened that push over the last year with its nearly $8 billion acquisition of health-care provider Signify Health and a $10.6 billion deal to buy Oak Street Health, which operates primary-care clinics for seniors.\n\nPressure on insurance unit\n\nCVS\u2019 health insurance segment generated $32.24 billion in revenue during the quarter, a more than 24% increase from the first quarter of 2023. The division includes plans by Aetna for the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, as well as dental and vision.\n\nSales blew past analysts\u2019 estimate of $30.69 billion for the period, according to StreetAccount. \n\nBut the insurance division reported adjusted operating income of just $732 million for the first quarter. That is well below analysts\u2019 expectation of $1.19 billion, according to FactSet. \n\nThe segment\u2019s medical benefit ratio \u2014 a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected \u2014 increased to 90.4% from 84.6% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that the company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.\n\nAnalysts had expected that ratio to be 88.4%, according to FactSet estimates. \n\nCVS said the rise was mainly driven by increased utilization of Medicare Advantage and the \u201cunfavorable impact\u201d of the company\u2019s Medicare Advantage star ratings. Those ratings help Medicare patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \n\nCVS added that an additional day in 2024 due to the leap year also contributed to the higher medical benefit ratio. \n\nHealth services, pharmacy businesses miss\n\nThe company\u2019s health services segment generated $40.29 billion in revenue for the quarter, a nearly 10% drop compared with the same quarter in 2023. \n\nThe division includes CVS Caremark, which negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, along with health-care services delivered in medical clinics, through telehealth and at home.\n\nThose sales were in line analysts\u2019 estimate of $40.29 billion in revenue for the period, according to FactSet. \n\nCVS said the decline was driven in part by the loss of the unnamed client and \u201ccontinued pharmacy client price improvements.\u201d The decrease was partially offset by growth in Oak Street Health, Signify Health and specialty pharmacy services, which help patients who are suffering from complex disorders and require specialized therapy. \n\nThe health services division processed 462.9 million pharmacy claims during the quarter, down from the 587.3 million during the year-ago period. \n\nCVS\u2019s pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $28.73 billion in sales for the first quarter, up almost 3% from the same period a year earlier. That segment dispenses prescriptions in CVS\u2019 more than 9,000 brick-and-mortar retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as diagnostic testing and vaccination. \n\nAnalysts had expected the division to bring in $29.5 billion in sales, according to FactSet. \n\nThe company said the rise was primarily driven by heightened prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations. Pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the launch of new generic drugs and decreased front-store volume, among other factors, weighed on the division\u2019s sales. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/cvs-health-cvs-earnings-q1-2024.html",

I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.\n\nThe RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.\n\nIf you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.\n\nWe see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.\n\nI continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!\n\nEDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTICKER --- NAME --- SHARE PRICE --- RSI Value\n\nACN\tAccenture Plc          F\t286.63\t69.31095528\n\nAMT\tAmern Tower Corp\t248.56\t69.37330112\n\nBLK\tBlackrock Inc\t810.35\t69.6989941\n\nUPS\tUnited Parcel Srvc Cl B\t179.51\t69.90349866\n\nMSFT\tMicrosoft Corp\t260.48\t69.97840519\n\nGOOGL\tAlphabet Inc Class A\t2279.265\t70.16983523\n\nNVDA\tNvidia Corp\t639.7401\t70.3677927\n\nMDT\tMedtronic Plc          F\t125.44\t70.59726396\n\nALL\tAllstate Corp\t122.04\t70.47226611\n\nWFC\tWells Fargo & Co\t43.535\t70.6544173\n\nNEE\tNextera Energy Inc\t81.21\t70.71177907\n\nGOOG\tAlphabet Inc Class C\t2294\t71.17607361\n\nUNH\tUnitedhealth Grp Inc\t388.82\t71.55161476\n\nCOST\tCostco Wholesale Co\t372.42\t71.63217977\n\nTGT\tTarget Corp\t208.54\t72.83200563\n\nSBUX\tStarbucks Corp\t117.615\t73.02642901\n\nADBE\tAdobe Inc\t522.73\t73.29936593\n\nBRK/B\tBerkshire Hathaway\t271.97\t73.78546388\n\nSO\tSouthern Co\t64.88\t74.75283354\n\nHON\tHoneywell Intl Inc\t230.57\t75.63350296\n\nEXC\tExelon Corp\t46.03\t77.6415172\n\nPFE\tPfizer Inc\t38.585\t78.0424713\n\nDUK\tDuke Energy Corp\t100.72\t78.63564751\n\nORCL\tOracle Corp\t78.77\t79.62182981\n\nLMT\tLockheed Martin Corp\t391.41\t79.8498989\n\nLOW\tLowes Cos Inc\t207.15\t81.33604962\n\nHD\tHome Depot Inc\t326.16\t81.59148035",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 23, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week\u2019s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).\n\nLast week, equities came under pressure after the Fed\u2019s July meeting minutes, which said \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Food and Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. \n* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe\u201d.\n* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. \n* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.\n* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney \u201cshop in a shop\u201d locations in 2019.\n* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson\u2019s flight a few weeks ago.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120\n* Abbott Labs (ABT) target raised by Cowen from $125 to $140 at Outperform. Stock currently around $126\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Loop Capital from $208 to $253 at Buy.

        "post_text": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Currently I do not use trailing stop loss orders but I was talking to a veteran trader yesterday at a conference. The trader said the average person could make a lot more money if they took all of their money and set 1% or 2% trailing stop losses on their orders. In other words say your average investor/trader has $20k in their brokerage. They wait for a few red days in a row and then put all $20k into one stock they believe is oversold and will run up in months to come. They buy the stock and then immediately put in a trailing top loss order of 2% so worst case scenario is they loose 2%. Stock runs up 5% in a week then drops 8% the week after? You are still making a profit because it sells after a 2% drop after the 5% recent peak so you walk with a 3% profit. \n\nThis seems like a hack and something everyone should be doing. It begs the question why doesn\u2019t everyone do this? I know people out there who have a ton of money in stocks and have no type of orders out there - these same people have lost tons of money when stocks like Netflix, Carvana, etc have gone down >10% in a day. \n\nIs this veteran trader full of it or is there some method to their madness?

        "post_text": "Is Pfizer a reasonable buy? I've been keeping up with Pfizer for a while and it seems the wind has really been taken out of sail for this once pandemic high flyer. \n\nWhy I think Pfizer is attractive is twofold, valuation and pipeline. For valuation, it is currently trading bellow it's historical in P/E of 15 (currently 10) and P/FE of 25 (currently 15). The valuation is so cheap that Pfiizer is trading bellow its 2019 levels despite having a better balance sheet and having acquired two small pharma companies, and in the process of acquiring a large one. Yes they've had to raise debt for the Seagen acquisition but the previous two have been paid in cash and essentially artifacts of the Covid vaccine success.\n\nNext is their pipeline which has many candidates that are reason to be excited about.  Notably is Danuglipron is their current GLP-1 candidate. The initial Phase two results showed that it's not as viable for diabetes as obesity but the larger market is obesity regardless. At high doses, Danuglipron is more effective than Rybelsus for obesity as oppose to less effective for diabetes, which is a significant step in the right direction with a caveat. Unlike many commercial GLP-1, Danuglipron is a twice oral drug rather than an injection like Monjourno. There is notably only one competitor in this market and that is Novo Nordisk with Rybelsus. For other commercialization endeavors, the US government ending their paxlovid contract now allows Pfizer to market it directly. this should make the product much higher margin as has been disclosed that the list price has more than doubled. \n\nAll Pharma stocks are in the dumpster in 2023 but this one more than most. Naturally, sentiment has been bad with the vaccine companies for the past two years, but how are you feeling about $PFE now? \n\n&#x200B;",

From what I understand is that it was originally developed for diabetics, and it was found to be an excellent weight loss drug and Eli Lily and Novo Nordisk got approval for not just diabetics but for weight loss, so doctors can prescribe it to non diabetics for weight loss, and this is been extremely profitable for them. \n\nSo the question is, is this drug difficult to make? Whats stopping everyone else from making their own Mounjaro/Ozempic ? If a company like Abbvie comes out with a new GLP-1 and it turns out to be more effect than the others, wouldn\u2019t that crash the price of LLY? I mean I understand cornering the market with a product but it seems like this is a drug that everyone could potentially make as well , there could be dozens of these on the market in a few years maybe?

I'm just an investor that's listened to an absurd number of Moderna podcasts.** While I've invested in Moderna for its mRNA platform (which I believe sets it apart from its competitors), there are of course other Pharma companies that also utilize mRNA technology, of which Pfizer-BioNTech is a very notable example.\r  \n\r  \nThere's no way the following list is complete, so please let me know what I've missed in the comments & of course any mistakes!... I'm up for learning.\r  \n\r  \n**So, why do I think Moderna's mRNA is superior to Old Pharma's methods:**\n\n\r  \n1) Using mRNA **you can make medicines which are technically undoable** using small molecule old chemistry technology. A 09Apr22 Pod at3.00 said ***only c.30% of the proteins in the body were accessible with old pharma / biotech drugs***.. i.e. mRNA gives access the 30% & all the rest.\r  \n\n\n2) Using mRNA **you get rapid & iterative development** (\"tweaks\" to improve the code), bringing down drug cycle time from Pharma's 6-8yrs down to Moderna's c.2yrs. ***Moderna credits its ability to rapidly tweak its mRNA code with why it only took an average of 1-2 years to move their CV19, RSV & flu programs from Phase 1 to the end of Phase 3***.\r  \n\n\n3) **With mRNA our bodies cells create the vaccine**, it's not grown outside the body. Think of it as, ***mRNA turning human cells into medicine factories, producing their own disease-fighting proteins, essentially outsourcing part of the vaccine production to our own cells***! As an example: In the case of Flu, vaccines are slowly cultured on the fluid from chicken embryos which takes time. Because that method takes time, currently the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended **quad**rivalent (i.e. **4 types**) strains are selected a considerable time in advance, ***with mRNA on the scene they could select problem flu strains later, with better knowledge, resulting (hopefully) in a better match to the prevalent strain***.\n\n\r  \n4) With mRNA there's **a lower chance of toxicity issues**. On a 24Jun20 pod\\] at20.14 (Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel) said \"the raw material of Moderna is genetic information, this is not something we guess. If you think about it, ***most chemicals tested by pharma have toxicity issues*** because they don\u2019t exist in nature, ***they're not supposed to be in the human body***, but ***the protein we get made by mRNA have existed in the human body forever, so the probability of success will be higher***\" \r  \n\n\n5) mRNA from the outset **has a better/quicker chance of finding a drug solution**.. a St\u00e9phane Bancel pod (2021 ep89 at29.40) put is this way.. Another thing that's fascinating about this ***mRNA technology***, which I've never seen in pharma before, is that y***ou design your product to spec***. You ***start backwards from what problem you\u2019re trying to solve*** (e.g. the solution for a disease), just as an architect would draw up plans before building a house, *unlike old pharma which works forward from the best molecule you can give me from a lab*.. ***For CMV we didn't start by saying we need 6 mRNA, no we said what\u2019s the right biology to make a vaccine that will get approved because it's going to work safely***.\r  \n\n\n6) Using mRNA, unlike Old Pharma, **you don't need a sample of the virus** & all the attendant handling risks with say infectious disease. They ***just need a genome sequence***.\r  \n\n\n7) Using mRNA can lead to **capital/manufacturing efficiencies**, leading to **cheaper drugs or (of course) larger margins**. In Moderna\u2019s case, ***each of their new manufacturing sites will support their entire drug platform***, with the ability to go from mRNA vaccines (you don\u2019t yet have the disease) to mRNA therapeutics (you have the disease). \r  \n\n\n8) mRNA **can lead to quicker drug discovery**. An obvious example of this is Moderna & Pfizer/BioNTech Covid response compared to Old Pharma\u2019s efforts. \r  \n\r  \nOld Pharma is of course investing in mRNA, partnering with mRNA companies & even acquiring a few businesses (hopefully Moderna it too large, not interested!). To be honest I reckon this is great for society, however **I believe Moderna's Platform which is solely focused on mRNA** (no legacy old Pharma stuff!), **10+yrs of \u201cData Assets\u201d** \\[I've covered this in previous posts\\] **& its manufacturing process will keep it ahead of the pack** although there's plenty to go around.\r  \n\r  \nGood luck in whatever you decide to invest in!\t\r  \n",

This article contains the list: https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html\n\nI know other brokerages restricted GME/AMC. But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. \n\nNow that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again.",

But that dark chapter of medical history may soon be drawing to a close. That\u2019s the hope in Washington, D.C., at least, where scientists with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Moderna have announced that human trials for the company\u2019s experimental HIV vaccine have officially begun.\n\n\u201cWe are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna's mRNA platform,\u201d said IAVI president and CEO Mark Feinberg in the announcement. \u201cThe search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine.\u201d Human candidates, recruited for clinical trials last August, received the study\u2019s first shots on Thursday at George Washington University\u2019s School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The vaccine builds on technology developed by Moderna during their COVID-19 vaccine production, with the goal of using mRNA to boost HIV immunogens and prevent the virus from disabling B cells, which are essential to fighting disease.\n\nAlthough medicines like PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have proved somewhat effective in slowing the spread of HIV and reducing its mortality, the virus is still a threat to global health nearly forty years after it was first identified. Scientists hope to conclude human trials next year in 2023, coinciding with HIV\u2019s grim 40th anniversary. \u201cWe believe advancing this HIV vaccine program in partnership with IAVI and Scripps Research is an important step in our mission to deliver on the potential for mRNA to improve human health,\u201d said Moderna president Stephen Hoge. Only time will tell whether this vaccine will succeed where others have failed \u2014 but we\u2019ll be praying, crossing our digits, and wishing on every star that by next year, LGBTQ+ communities around the globe will have a new reason to celebrate.\n\nhttps://www.them.us/story/hiv-aids-vaccine-human-trials-modern",

        "post_text": "Moderna (MRNA): To paraphrase.. It's not about Covid, stupid! The stock boomed on its Covid product, then collapsed as the disease moved from pandemic (it's out of control) to endemic (manageable, but always present). However, on the back of this one product the company made tens of $bn's, using this windfall to target other respiratory diseases (primarily flu & RSV) & ploughed $4-5bn R&D a year into pivoting & broadening its product pipeline.\n\n**When thinking of Moderna, forget about Covid**, it's good for paying current bills & provides a handy annuity-like stream of future (diminished) earnings, but **it arguably plays just a bit part on why anyone would buy (like I have) Moderna**.\n\nModerna's Covid vaccine sits within its Respiratory / Infectious disease \"modality\", with another 6 modalities (e.g. cancer, latent diseases, rare disease, Inhaled pulmonary etc) rounding out their portfolio. The portfolio has 45 development programs, across 4 therapeutic areas, of which 9 are late stage. I didn\u2019t think much of these numbers until I heard (16Jun21 Pod at46.10) that it was \"a high number compared to a 5-10yr old biotech company that will generally have 2-3 clinical candidates!\"... What the heck, the power of a mRNA platform over Old Pharm / Biotech!\n\nSo, **there's a remarkably fat pipeline** of which their Covid vaccine may in the future play a relatively small part. Nonetheless, they're currently still just a 1-drug-company-with-a-lovely-fantasy-story until some of these other products get approved..... ***The following is a brief overview of part of their late stage pipeline***.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) Next-Gen COVID (mRNA1283)** \\#Added 3 days later, having originally missed it off the list#\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: Previously the World, now a greatly reduced forecasted sales of c.$4bn.\n\n**KEY DATES**: ***Expected in 1H24***\n\n**COMPETITORS**: Primarily Pfizer/BioNTech\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: mRNA1283 is an update of mRNA1273 (Spikevax), designed to be refrigerator-stable. Phase 1/2 clinical study elicited a potent neutralizing antibody response comparable to 50 \u00b5g mRNA1273, using a lower dose levels, all in all it demonstrated encouraging results in multiple clinical studies. Phase 3 had 11.5k in the trial, enrolled between Apr-Aug23.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) RSV: Respiratory Syncytial Virus**\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: Potential to be >$10bn market ($2-4bn maternal & pediatrics and $6-8bn older adults), globally 1.5m cases & c336k hospitalizations.\n\n**KEY DATES**: *US approval decision on* ***12May24***. CDC recommendations at a vaccine meeting in late ***Jun24.***\n\n**COMPETITORS**: Two.. GSK (Arexvy) & Pfizer (Abrysvo)\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: *Received* ***\u201cbreakthrough\u201d designation from FDA***. Moderna\u2019s data showed an efficacy of 84% at 3.3Mths & c.63% after 8.6Mths. Compared to GSK's fall from 83% to 77% at 14Mths & Pfizer's fall from 89% to 79% at 14mths... So it\u2019s NOT good?... HOWEVER, it's not a like for like comparison, being a different calendar period & for 3 symptoms V. their 2, with Pfizer\u2019s 14Mth efficacy against 2 symptoms falling from 67% to 49%. Overall, they all passed their efficacy levels, with Moderna's pre filled syringe v. 4-9 steps for the others a positive differentiator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) Flu & Combos (Flu/Covid)**:\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: The current flu market is c.$6bn, however could grow to c.$9bn in 2028. Worldwide 3-5M severe cases of influenza & 290-650K deaths annually.\n\n**KEY DATES**: ***Intend to file for the flu in 2024***... The combination ***flu/Covid phase 3 data expected in 2024***.\n\n**COMPETITORS**: Primarily it\u2019s Sanofi\u2019s Fluzone, a currently licensed vaccine.\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: Flu met it's primary endpoint in a Phase 3 trial, outperforming Sanofi\u2019s Fluzone at tackling 3 strains & as able on the 4th strain. ***Intends to file in 2024***... *The combo* ***has \u201cFast Track\u201d designation from FDA*** & has recently initiated a Phase 3 trial with the *intention to have a combination vaccine available as* ***early as 2025.*** ......... With regards to Flu, Old Pharma requires a long lead time to prepare, while mRNA is much quicker which could allow a later in the season product to be created providing a better match with the actual (not WHO forecasted 4 variants) outbreak. Old Pharma gets c.60% efficacy in a good year & c.20-25%, leaving the door wide open for mRNA products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) CMV**: Cytomegalovirus; Birth defects/miscarriage, 2-3x Downs Syndrome, transplant complications.\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: Globally there are c. 40m births a year, with an estimated market of $2-5bn/pa.\n\n**KEY DATES**: Given the rate of case accrual that they're seeing in the study, they're pretty confident that they're going to be seeing a readout from the interim analysis, ***possibly*** even the final analysis for ***efficacy in 2024***.\n\n**COMPETITORS**: Zero. There is currently no vaccine.\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: *CMV has been designated a* ***\u201ctop priority\u201d*** *in new vaccine development by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine* ***for more than two decades!*** This is a highly complex virus, with Moderna's vaccine having 6 mRNA molecules per vial (for perspective, Covid had just 1). Their phase 2 results are frankly difficult to understand, however the Moderna CEO said ***\"the phase 2 CMV data is phenomenal.***\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5) INT**: Individualized Neoantigen Therapy; In particular, for adjuvant melanoma (skin cancer) & adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) & more recently (11Mar24) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC; a form of skin cancer)\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: In 2020 global cancer, all types, rose to >19m new cases & 10m deaths. They're currently targeting a small subset of this, but are expected to expand... Note Merck's Keytruda costs $150k/yr per patient, selling c.$2bn/yr, with INT expected to be approx. the same.\n\n**KEY DATES**: They are ***looking for accelerated approval in 2024***, if not then likely 2025.\n\nCOMPETITORS: There is no one doing what they are doing. An individualized cancer treatment, based on your own personal cancer!\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: A Moderna & Merck joint product. It's ***received \u201cBreakthrough Therapy\u201d Designation from FDA*** *in Feb23 &* ***\u201cPRIME Designation\u201d from EMA*** *in Apr23*.. 3yr analysis of its Phase 2b study saw it reduce the risk of recurrence or death by 49% & the risk of developing distant metastasis or death by 62% \\[The 2yr data was 44% & 65%\\]. They are currently enrolling for phase 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6) Rare genetic diseases**: There are estimated to be *c. 10,000 rare diseases with a patient population of 1,000s-10,000s*. A pod I listened to suggested they *could sell for $100,000s per patient*, giving perhaps $100\u2019s million per drug which is overall quite small but the \"overall opportunity\" could be quite large across various drugs. In addition, *consider the colossal expense of RSV's 37k patient phase 3 trial against, the* ***rare disease 12-50 patients per study & you can get a sense of how much cheaper such Developments are*** (although the \"Research\" bit of the R&D I imagine is perhaps the same)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6A) PA**: Propionic; A rare inherited metabolic disorder.\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: 100-150k individuals worldwide.\n\n**KEY DATES**: They expect to advance it ***into a pivotal study in 2024***.\n\n**COMPETITORS**: Zero.\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**:  It *received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation,* ***Orphan Drug Designation*** *&* ***Fast Track Designation from the FDA***. Their phase 1/2 trial with 16 patients saw a reduction in Metabolic Decompensations Events (MDE; Considered a clinically meaningful endpoint for development) of 71% overall & of an 80% reduction via their 2wk regime dosage! I gather their next trial will focus on this 2wk regime dosage, with another Redditor (I think a doctor) saying \"I thought they would have filed for approval for the PA medication\", which I took to mean the data was as impressive as it looks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6B) MMA**: Methylmalonic acidemia; A inherited metabolic disorder, mainly affects babies.\n\n**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: 1/48K births, 21k patients\n\n**KEY DATES**: They expect to advance it ***into a pivotal study in 2024***.\n\n**COMPETITORS**: There are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for MMA.\n\n**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: Ongoing Phase 1/2 Study with 15 participants. Interim results demonstrated encouraging initial data in cohorts 2 & 3. They are currently dosing their 5th cohort & are selecting optimal dosing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***I didn\u2019t set out to write the most tedious article on Reddit, but I reckon I smashed it!*** Anyway, the not too subtle point which I hope I got across is investors should shift their gaze away from Covid (yesterday\u2019s news) to Moderna\u2019s pipeline. It would be great if all of the above succeed, however I don\u2019t think its actually required. Once just a few of the drugs are approved institutional money will once again begin to sniff around.",

        "post_text": "Moderna (MRNA): A personal investment case \r  \nI personally began investing in Moderna in Feb24, however have been tracking it for some time. As I find myself increasingly liking the stock I try to keep myself grounded by keeping the \"negatives\" front & center, so perhaps unusually I'd like to draw your attention to these first. \r  \n\r  \n**Negatives:** \r  \n\\- It\u2019s projected to makes losses for 2024 & 2025, but it has c.$13bn (covid-cash) reserves. \r  \n\\- Covid proved its system/platform, with it now tackling cancer, flu, CMV, HIV etc all of which are colossal markets. Having so many programmes mean they don\u2019t all have to succeed for the company to thrive, however any failure (particularly phase 3) will disappoint the market\u2019s sale/profit projections, this is exacerbated all the more by it (currently) having just ONE approved product (CV19).\r  \n\\- There are outstanding patent infringement lawsuits (e.g Pfizer & BioNTech, Alnylam, Arbutus and National Institute of Health).\r  \n\\- A great unknown is the industry wide impact of Biden's IRA act, allowing Medicare to negotiate some drug prices.\r  \n\\- A moderately large short position. Although this can also be considered a positive, if better than expected news leads to a short squeeze.\r  \n\\- All this makes it seriously volatile. If you are looking for a smooth stock, avert your gaze!!\r  \n\\- This isn\u2019t a ST stock. \r  \n\r  \n**Positives:**\r  \n**A BRIEF INTRO** as to what Moderna believes mRNA provides... \r  \n1) A large product opportunity: Numerous verticals/modalities using one centralised platform.  \r  \n2) Higher probability of technical success: Drug design through their digital/AI platform.  \r  \n3) Accelerated R&D timelines: The \u201cR\u201d in particular is shortened with numerous pre-clinical \u201cconstruct\u201d tests, generating highly targeted first attempts which can then be further \u201ctweaked.\u201d \r  \n4) Greater capital efficiency over time vs. recombinant technology: Points 1-3 & building up \u201cdata assets\u201d which loops back into software learning which in turn enhances. future drug designs AND of course its flexible manufacturing.\r  \n\r  \n**A BRIEF PODCAST SUMMARY** of a short podcast that I thought was pretty informative (Jan24 Yahoo Finance -Vaccines: There's 'so much noise' around facts: Moderna CEO), with \u201cat\u201d time stamps to allow easy checking. This includes some forward looking statements which of course may not come to fruition.\r  \nAt4.30 This year we are going to see a firework of amazing data. \r  \nAt5.00 RSV should be approved very soon in a few months, we filed last summer.   \r  \nAt5.10 We have positive phase 3 data for flu & it should be filed in the coming months to regulators as our 3rd product.  \r  \nAt5.15 We should get very soon the Flu/Covid results around midyear, when we get that data, I believe it will be very positive as phase 2 was very strong, we've never seen in a vaccine when phase 2 was great not to then be successful in phase 3. We will file these potentially by the end of the year.   \r  \nAt5.40 then CMV which is in phase 3.. the phase 2 CMV data is phenomenal, we are waiting for phase 3 this year.

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021 Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n> \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n> # Improving forecasts\n> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n> \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n> # Key data during the week\n> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n> \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n> \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n> \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n> # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

        "post_text": "Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) Navigating the Evolving COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape with a Diversified Pipeline **Overview**\n\nModerna, a pioneering biotechnology company, has transformed from a research-stage enterprise into a commercial powerhouse with a diverse clinical portfolio spanning infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company\u2019s first commercial product, the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax\u00ae, has already impacted hundreds of millions of lives globally. However, Moderna\u2019s story extends far beyond its COVID-19 success, as it continues to leverage its mRNA platform to advance a robust pipeline of 40 development candidates across 47 programs, 43 of which are currently in clinical studies.\n\n**Financials**\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, Moderna reported annual revenue of $6,754 million and a net loss of $4,714 million. The company\u2019s annual operating cash flow was negative $3,118 million, and its annual free cash flow was negative $3,825 million. These financial results reflect the significant investments Moderna is making to advance its diverse pipeline and build out its global commercial, regulatory, sales, and manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Moderna reported net product sales of $167 million, a significant decline from the $1,828 million reported in the same period of the prior year. This decrease is indicative of the evolving nature of the endemic COVID-19 vaccine market, which has transitioned toward a more seasonal commercial pattern. The company expects this trend to persist, resulting in further projected reductions in net product sales for its COVID-19 vaccine relative to 2023.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nDespite the decline in COVID-19 vaccine sales, Moderna remains focused on its long-term strategy of diversifying its revenue streams and advancing its robust pipeline. The company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine strategy for 2024 is centered on working with public health officials, healthcare providers, and pharmacies to increase vaccination coverage rates, particularly in the United States. In Europe, Moderna is actively participating in the 2024 tender process, which allows for up to 36 million doses per year for up to 4 years. In the Rest of the World, the company has reoriented its commercial teams to prioritize markets for greater commercial focus and impact, as evidenced by the recent contract with Brazil for 4.5 million doses.\n\n**Pipeline Progress**\n\nModerna\u2019s pipeline progress extends well beyond its COVID-19 vaccine. The company is eagerly awaiting the approval of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, which is expected to launch into a large market. In its first year, the older adult RSV market was $2.5 billion in sales, and analysts expect the older adults\u2019 market to grow between $6 billion and $8 billion per year. Moderna\u2019s RSV vaccine has a strong efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials and will be the only product available in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation, which the company believes will ease the burden on pharmacies during the fall respiratory season.\n\nIn addition to its respiratory vaccine portfolio, Moderna is making significant strides in its latent virus vaccines, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The company\u2019s CMV vaccine, mRNA-1647, has fully enrolled its Phase III trial, and Moderna is anticipating potential for Phase III efficacy data in 2024. The EBV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1189, has shown positive Phase I immunogenicity and safety data, and Moderna is now advancing towards pivotal trials.\n\nModerna\u2019s individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) program, developed in collaboration with Merck, continues to demonstrate promising results. The partners have initiated three new randomized clinical studies in additional tumor types in 2024, including a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma, a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and a Phase 2/3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe company\u2019s financial position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling approximately $12.2 billion as of March 31, 2024. This robust balance sheet enables Moderna to continue investing in its pipeline and commercial operations. In March 2024, the company entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement with Blackstone Life Sciences, which will provide up to $750 million in funding to support the advancement of Moderna\u2019s investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccine program.\n\nModerna\u2019s commitment to financial discipline is evident in its operating expense management. During the first quarter of 2024, the company\u2019s total operating expenses decreased by almost $800 million compared to the same period in 2023. This reduction was driven by lower spending in manufacturing, development, and selling, general, and administrative functions.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nLooking ahead, Moderna expects net sales for 2024 to be approximately $4 billion, which the company believes will be a low point as it expects to return to growth in 2025. The company anticipates cost of sales to be approximately 35% of product sales for the full year, down from 70% in 2023, reflecting improvements in manufacturing efficiency and expected reductions in inventory write-downs.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nModerna\u2019s diversified pipeline, strong financial position, and focus on operational efficiency position the company well to navigate the evolving COVID-19 vaccine market and continue advancing its broader therapeutic and vaccine programs. As the company continues to execute on its strategic priorities, investors will closely monitor the progress of its late-stage clinical candidates, including the RSV vaccine, CMV vaccine, and INT program, as well as the potential launch of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine programs.\n\nSource: [https://beyondspx.com/2024/07/30/moderna-nasdaqmrna-navigating-the-evolving-covid-19-vaccine-landscape-with-a-diversified-pipeline/](https://beyondspx.com/2024/07/30/moderna-nasdaqmrna-navigating-the-evolving-covid-19-vaccine-landscape-with-a-diversified-pipeline/)",

        "post_text": "Moderna (MRNA): After 8 previous posts (links included), a concluding summary post on commonly discussed topics I researched Moderna for several months, began buying in Feb24, then joined Reddit to share my thoughts & learn from fellow investors. As I\u2019ve posted a lot on Moderna over the last month (mostly in bold & italics!), here\u2019s a summary\n\n1. **Podcast links:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernaStock/comments/1bii2e4/moderna\\_podcasts\\_that\\_ive\\_listened\\_to\\_possibly\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernaStock/comments/1bii2e4/moderna_podcasts_that_ive_listened_to_possibly_of/)\n2. **A personal investment case:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bin4i9/moderna\\_mrna\\_a\\_personal\\_investment\\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bin4i9/moderna_mrna_a_personal_investment_case/)\n3. **Phase 3 drugs:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bkiv8o/moderna\\_mrna\\_to\\_paraphrase\\_its\\_not\\_about\\_covid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bkiv8o/moderna_mrna_to_paraphrase_its_not_about_covid/)\n4. **Digital, data & AI:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1blqel2/moderna\\_mrna\\_does\\_it\\_use\\_ai\\_in\\_its\\_research/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1blqel2/moderna_mrna_does_it_use_ai_in_its_research/)\n5. **mRNA is better than old pharma:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bmj2xe/moderna\\_mrna\\_why\\_mrna\\_represents\\_superior\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bmj2xe/moderna_mrna_why_mrna_represents_superior_tech/)\n6. **Patent issues:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bnfqla/moderna\\_mrna\\_are\\_their\\_patent\\_issues\\_a\\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bnfqla/moderna_mrna_are_their_patent_issues_a_short/)\n7. **Phase 2 drugs:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1buzufi/moderna\\_mrna\\_stock\\_analysts\\_are\\_unjustly\\_ignoring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1buzufi/moderna_mrna_stock_analysts_are_unjustly_ignoring/)\n8. **Its little known genomics & enzymatics work:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bwsh1y/moderna\\_mrna\\_its\\_little\\_known\\_genomics\\_enzymatics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bwsh1y/moderna_mrna_its_little_known_genomics_enzymatics/)  \\[FYI: \"No\\_Yogurtcloset\\_2547\" comment is a must read\\]\n\nOn the back of the above posts, I responded to various questions, many of which helped me to better understand the stock as I undertook research to fill in gaps. Similarly, quite often comments from others investors made me question things that I thought I knew, but probably didn\u2019t know well enough... It's all a learning process!\n\nThe following questions kept popping up in one guise or another. The following comments are meant to be in addition to what I\u2019ve previously written. As I\u2019ve tried to avoid repeating myself the various bits & bobs aren\u2019t meant to be fully formed answers but are instead addendum thoughts.\n\n***\\[Fair warning this is a long post, It\u2019s not meant for the TLDR brigade! I\u2019ve invested a fair amount in Moderna, accordingly I research thoroughly. It\u2019s my last such post!\\]***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHY BUY MODERNA?**\n\nPersonally, I'm investing my pension pot, hence my putting a lot of effort into understanding a stock that I plan on holding for several years & which I hope will give me a quality retirement drinking Rum & Whisky for many years to come!\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say this was covered a lot in my main posts, although perhaps not the following snippets.\n\n1\\] With old pharma, drug production starts from scratch each time, the success of one drug telling you nothing about the success of the next. As one podcast put it, \"each new drug needs to be built from scratch, its active ingredients combined & tested, it\u2019s much like making a one-of-a-kind hand-crafted artisanal toy.\" Given this, healthcare innovation is incredibly difficult, slow, expensive & most of its products fail (essentially, 90% of drugs that go into clinical trial will never get launched).\n\n2\\] 11Mar24 Motley.. Moderna's stock is very inexpensive at the moment, which is another reason to consider buying it. Whereas the biopharma sector has an average price-to-book (P/B) multiple of 6.3, Moderna\u2019s P/B is only 2.6.\n\n3\\] Their late stage phase 3 stuff is mostly respiratory. If that was it, I'm not sure I would buy Moderna either. Sure it's valuable, with large markets & combos (Flu/Covid, Flu/RSV) hopefully increasing shot uptake, with overworked pharmacists going for their RSV prefilled syringes rather than taking the time to reconstitute the competitor's vaccine in 4-9 steps. Equally, I get the bit that they can't be cured & will sadly be around forever, which of course means a stream of income (Initially reduced from the past) for Moderna.\n\n***Platform points:***\n\nA\\] You're buying a technology platform that quickly & safely delivers these new mRNA-based drugs, many of which are technically undoable using small molecule chemistry technology of pharma (just look at CMV!). All in all, its platform allows for rapid & iterative development \\[e.g. An earlier version of its flu vaccine was no better than current jabs for two of the four most common flu strains. Moderna reformulated it & the new version is now better than Sanofi\u2019s Fluzone at tackling three of the flu strains & is just as capable with the 4th strain\\].\n\nB\\] Senior management just love the platform they've built, with Bancel himself (01Nov21 pod at23.50) referring it to as the \"goose that lays the golden eggs \\[drugs\\].. We invest in science to grow the platform potential.. A team may work on getting mRNA into a new cell type, which opens a new Moderna vertical. This improvement in the platform's feature/capabilities we can then use for all the drugs we do forever!\u201d\n\nC\\] For me, the platform is the root of the investment case, that with their 10+yrs of \"data assets\" tied into to their new state of the art flexible manufacturing is their competitive advantage / their \"moat\". This is what churns out the drug prospects.\n\nRight now, Moderna isn't for everyone, especially if you\u2019re just choosing one stock. However, it possibly has a place as part of a diversified portfolio as it's not highly corelated to the market (i.e. per portfolio theory, adding it to a portfolio could actually reduce the portfolio's overall risk).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHY SELL/SHORT MODERNA? WHAT SHOULD SHORTS SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR**\n\nAlthough I clearly like the stock, like any investment there are pros & cons. I wrote about what I consider its main negatives in post #2 (A personal investment case). To this collection, I\u2019d add the following.\n\n1\\] As an investor, I consider myself a Moderna FUTURIST looking past the here & now, which in the share price tug-of-war I reckon makes the other side\u2026 ***THE REALISTS***: You're loss making, you've only got 1 drug & Covid is a shadow of its former self, your cash won't last forever given your $4-5bn R&D expenditure, you're going to lose your patent fights, there's a load of shorters.\n\n2\\] The market cap is high for a company with just a single product. Moderna is priced on its potential, it needs to deliver.\n\n***3\\] What shorts should look out for:***\n\n3A) My feeling is that Moderna has too many phase 3 drugs (I think its 9 now) in their pipeline to confidently short-and-forget. Also, when you get share spikes in the region of 10% just on the announcement of a new INT cancer trial (& there are sadly dozens of them, possibly suggesting there are more spikes to come) you've got to think there are safer things out there to short.\n\n3B) Their 25Sep23 blog post said \"we aim to double the number of programs in Phase 3 by 2025. In the preclinical realm, we expect to advance 50 new drug candidates into clinical trials.\" Essentially, If you\u2019re short, unrelenting press releases on innovative new drugs isn\u2019t great!\n\n3C) Per Yahoo Finance, Moderna's \"short % of float\" is 7.7%, with anything <10% apparently indicating strong positive sentiment. With c.22.2m shares short & given an average 3Mth trading volume of 4.0m this represents a modest 5.6 days trading, however if you think shorts perhaps only get 30% of the volume (e.g. panicked short covering often occurs on positive news days, thereby exacerbating price spikes) you're then looking at 19+ days of squeeze.. Lovely if you\u2019re long, not so much if you\u2019re short!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE SHORT TERM?**\n\nI get that for many it's counter intuitive to buy a stock that by its own forecasts will be loss making in 2024 & 2025 with a 2026 breakeven. However, leaving aside the fact that it's pretty clearly making a business decision (which I approve of) to be loss making by spending $4-5bn on R&D a year, for me this is a Buffet \"be greedy when others are fearful\" moment.\n\nI've no idea what this crazy volatile stock will do over the next couple of months, however I think the stock will be on a firmer footing from 12May24 \\[RSV date!\\] & if it stumbles then, well we have news releases (hopefully in 2024) on Flu, CMV, INT & Rare Diseases to look forward to! If RSV is approved on 12May, then I hope it is the first of many new drug that launches which should gradually diversify their revenue stream, as other modalities get added to the respiratory franchise.\n\nPersonally, I think Moderna's risk is higher over the short term than the long term. Will they launch XYZ drug in a year, perhaps, will they have launched XYZ drug in 3years is a lot more likely as time is valuable in that \"things\" are more likely to occur \\[e.g. The Flu example I mentioned above\\]\n\nI hope I'm getting in early (my risk appetite is high), however I think there'll still be loads of opportunity for others to jump on board after Moderna has launched a few more products & the company is on a sounder footing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE LONG TERM?**\n\nIf Moderna launches most, all aren't necessary, of the phase 2 & 3 drugs it expects by 2028 I don't see why it shouldn't be making its way towards new all-time highs.\n\n***Obviously***, a lot of things have to go right to make this happen\u2026\n\n\\- It really depends on how much of their $52bn addressable market (see their 27Mar24 press release) they manage to capture. However, $27bn is in respiratory \\[Covid & RSV c.$10bn each & Flu $7bn\\] which has a high barrier to entry (trial costs) with limited competitors, while the remaining $25bn is in latent & other vaccines \\[By 2028 CMV $12bn, EBV $1.1bn, VZV $5.6bn, Norovirus $3-6bn\\], a lot of which (at least at first) have zero competitors in markets with colossal unmet needs.\n\n\\- If you consider that Moderna's total sales in their best years was 2021 $18.5bn & 2022 $19.3bn, were the share price was quite a bit higher, you'll see why I\u2019m optimistic.\n\n\\- It might not happen as soon as we would like & undoubtedly there will be a few disappointments on the way, however time is our friend as the platform keeps chugging out potential products.\n\nAll in all, I don't think the future potential has been priced in yet. As discussed above, just the mention of a new Moderna/Merck INT cancer trial drove a sharp rally. I confess I\u2019m as puzzled by this dramatic movement as much as the next Moderna investor as management have previously discussed their thoughts on possible new usages, however it nicely illustrates that there\u2019s a big chunk of the market that still perceives Moderna just as a Covid stock. For the uniformed it\u2019s as surprising as Apple announcing it has a dating website!\n\nBancel (CEO) is calling this \u201cthe year of execution.\u201d As a new Moderna Investor, I\u2019m fully aware I\u2019ve invested at a pivotal moment & plan on holding through the short term noise / uncertainty. Again, time is our friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHY IS MODERNA SO RISKY/VOLATILE:**\n\nThe risk of Moderna's shares, as measured by the standard deviation of its daily share price, is undoubtedly high. And frankly even over the longer term using weekly / monthly share price data, it\u2019s still darned high.\n\nIn essence, stock markets hate uncertainty. However, Moderna's near term runway will certainly be a lot clearer by the end of the year.\n\n1. Getting any other drug approved by a regulator kicks away the one-trick-pony line.\n2. Getting a drug approved outside the respiratory modality (i.e. not RSV, Flu, their combos), strengthens their platform / mRNA breadth claim.\n3. Either but preferably both I reckon demands an analyst rerating based on a higher probability of success for the rest of their phase 3 pipeline & perhaps some analysts penciling in some future profits from their fat phase 2 class.\n\nOver time the buy/sell tug-of-war ***on possible drugs*** will morph into a discussion of ***actual approved drugs*** & forecasted sales. I believe, as its future becomes less uncertain & its financial position strengthens, the stock\u2019s volatility will gradually fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**R&D SPENDING**\n\nModerna is accepting near term 2024 & 2025 losses, in part to boost their R&D spend ($4.5bn TY). Their R&D spending is like that of a long established Old Pharma, rather than that of a 14yr old company. If required, their CFO is on the record saying that they will push back on some projects &/or bring in development partners like they did with Merck for INT.\n\nThe following table (13Sep23 Investor Event - R&D Day presentation p152) shows the respiratory expenditure decline in 2026 (NOT coincidentally the year they forecast breaking even!) as they pivot into the other modalities.\n\nRespiratory: 2024(No.1), 2025(1), 2026(2), 2027(4), 2028(4)\n\nLatent & other ID: 2024(2), 2025(2), 2026(1), 2027(1), 2028(1)\n\nOncology: 2024(3), 2025(3), 2026(3), 2027(2), 2028(2)\n\nRare Disease: 2024(4), 2025(4), 2026(4), 2027(3), 2028(3)\n\nPlatform Investments: 2024-2028 (No.5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IS MODERNA GOING TO RUN OUT OF CASH?**\n\nGiven that revenues from its sole commercial drug (Covid) have plummeted & it\u2019s R&D spending is pretty high, this is a key question for Moderna. I\u2019ll be honest in that I personally just had faith that they wouldn\u2019t (not exactly scientific!), until I came across an excellent recent podcast (11Mar24 \"Moderna's CFO on how to allocate capital in big pharma\", 55mins) that reassured me.\n\n\\-  at11.50 (***Being mindful of their cash***).. We have to ensure we have a sustainable company & bring the most drugs to the market with the highest probability of success\n\n\\-  at13.05 (***Not wasting their cash***).. Historically over the last couple of years we have bought back shares although we have stopped buying shares at this point because we primarily want to invest in this pipeline.\n\n\\-  at10.55 (***Why is their burn rate so high?***).. Respiratory vaccines is a very large market, we think $30bn between flu/Covid/RSV & there's only a few players & a very high barrier to entry because you have to test so many patients in those trials they're quite expensive... at46.40 RSV with 37,000 patients it was in the $100's million from an investment perspective. Once it's ready that RSV vaccine probably won't be tweaked too much, maybe a little bit of tweaking over time, but we've just cleared a high barrier of entry were as of right now there's only 2 competitors.\n\nEssentially, Respiratory is just one modality out of the 7 they are currently looking at, of which I think 4 have drug prospects. Respiratory trials are notoriously expensive (See the R&D spending section above), hence the relatively low competition. Moderna of course recognises this, as such it has been pivoting into new modalities for several years now. However, it\u2019s worth pointing that as you can\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d its targeted respiratory diseases, income should continue to flow for a considerable time despite a forecasted massive reduction on respiratory R&D\u2026 which is of course great for shareholders.\n\n\\- One such area it\u2019s pivoting to is rare diseases. A 13Sep23 R&D event at 3hr5min stated  \"There's a lot of opportunity in rare disease, to go quickly with much smaller trials.... We are hoping for very small studies, 12-50 patients in these studies.\" \u2026. I would guess that the overall \u201cR\u201d is probably the same but the \u201cD\u201d an order of magnitude less!\n\nModerna has also struck ***partnership deals***, to get paid money, to share development costs (e.g. With Merck for its INT cancer treatment), as well as to get access to knowledge/abilities it doesn\u2019t have. Furthermore, a recent ***$750m funding agreement*** with Blackstone Life Sciences connected to its flu product, essentially allows them to advance their overall pipeline which they said was \u201ca pretty easy trade for us.. a good deal for us.\"\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s moving at breakneck speed on a serious number drug prospects, moving fast & breaking new ground in an effort to secure patents etc, chasing low hanging (rare disease) fruit, however lack of cash isn\u2019t an issue!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**JAMEY MOCK, MODERNA\u2019s CFO \\[A PERSONAL FAVOURITE!\\]**\n\nThis section is for me! No one ever raised a question regarding the CFO or ever mentioned him, however they play such a vital role that frankly without an accomplished CFO the company will underperform.\n\nHe\u2019s only been with Moderna for just over 1.5yrs, but I reckon you can see his CFO fingerprints everywhere. He gets namechecked in podcasts & in video performances you\u2019ll frequently see the rest of the senior management team, including Bancel, looking his way. Bancel (CEO) in my eyes is a visionary & an undoubtedly an impressive front man, however Jamey is an increasingly important figure.\n\nI credit the following to Jamey (often with no basis in fact, other than it\u2019s part of the CFO role or within its purview!)\n\n1. He has enhanced financial discipline over the drug pipeline \\[the Zika decision was within his realm\\]\n2. Stopped wasteful buybacks \\[they have their place, but a limited cashflow company should leave well alone\\]\n3. Increased visibility over the 2026 breakeven date \\[CFO\u2019s are usually overly conservative, possibly building in a future positive surprise???\\]\n4. Savagely wrote off historical Covid era deals/products \\[kitchen sinking bad news, enhancing future results\\]\n5. Rationalized manufacturing suppliers \\[hard financial decisions were made, despite knowing the market would focus on the short term impact\\]\n6. Struck a sweet loan deal \\[see above. This year\u2019s R&D isn\u2019t impacted, I presume it\u2019ll flow nicely into next year\\]\n7. Helped improve the professionalism of Moderna\u2019s institutional investment proposition \\[I think this is clearcut, but open to debate\\]\n\nModerna is doing a better job of explaining itself (\u201cthe year of execution\u201d) & I think has financially grounded itself. I believe Jamie has a lot to do with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Does mRNA have failures?**\n\nModerna of course has it's failures, we just don't see them to the same extent as Old Pharma\u2019s. Consider the following...\n\n1. 16Jun21 pod at56.30 .. With mRNA you can do 100 different drugs \\[pre-clinical \u201cconstructs\u201d via inexpensive small animal proof of concept studies\\] for the same disease quite rapidly versus a traditional drug design approach where you could just do 1 or 2.. Iterate & rapidly figure out the best construct.\n\n\\- Essentially they blast through a load of potential prospects finding the best candidate.\n\n\\- Also, the whole point of the platform is that each modality gradually gets better over time, learning from its success/failures. What they learnt from Covid, helped them with RSV & Flu but less so with say their INT cancer drug which is in a different modality. I think this also has to do with their LNP (small globs of fat that surround their synthetic mRNA) design which can change for different needs e.g their Cystic fibrosis one can work in the lungs\n\n2) 10Jan24 Forbes.. This is the beauty of our mRNA platform\u2014we can de-risk a product and quickly reprogram it, notes Mock, who points to an experimental flu vaccine that disappointed Moderna investors early last year when it came up short in a late-stage trial. However, after tweaking the formula behind the mRNA vaccine, within 6Mths it had met all of the goals needed for a successful shot in a Phase 3 trial. \u201cThis is the kind of rapid development and type of proof that is now giving us a high probability of success\u201d say Mock.",

        "post_text": "Moderna (MRNA): Its little known genomics & enzymatics work is quite possibly the future of Moderna I\u2018ve read a heck of a lot about Moderna & listened to loads of podcasts, however for whatever reason I didn\u2019t come across their genomics work a great deal. If like me you don\u2019t have any medical training, (**basically**) *genomics is focused on studying the DNA of an organism (i.e. its genome) while enzymatics is about enzymes, which are proteins that accelerate chemical reactions (without enzymes speeding things up, the cell is stuffed!). All in all, enzymatics is advancing the genomics industry, with gene editing performed using enzymes*.\n\nCompared to Moderna\u2019s work in it\u2019s drug modalities & news of its ever expanding drug pipeline, **there is a distinct lack of publicly available information on its genomics business**. I find this a bit puzzling, as from what I have come across **they clearly have VERY high hopes for its potential**. I didn't invest in Moderna for this, but I like it!\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. 31May**22** \"111 Extraordinary leaps need solid foundations part 2 - Stephane Bancel\" (38mins) pod.. at33.40 ***Our goal is to vastly improve gene editing techniques***.. We think there is a lot of ways to improve gene editing technology to basically go & cut your DNA inside your body to put in a better piece of DNA to make you healthier or to cure a disease. That will take a bit longer, but ***it might have a much more profound impact on life***.\n2. 22Mar**23** \u201cFounder Stories: Ste\u0301phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna\u201d (17mins) pod.. at13.00 ***Think 3-5yrs, what are the big Moderna leaps coming***..... at15.15 I believe ***we're going to become the biggest genomics company on the planet***, because ***we're going to leapfrog the \"Crispr cas9\" companies*** because **we now have huge investment in gene editing** we're ***looking at 3rd & 4th generation of gene editing enzymes that we code with our mRNA technology*** \\[BB: rather than using mRNA to code for a protein\\]....**Once we get the right enzymes you're going to see this company flying, we're going go from zero gene editing programs to 40**.\n\nInterestingly, the **only acquisition they have ever made was in genomics**, granted in part ***to improve their core mRNA-coding-for-a-protein business***. On 04Jan23 they spent $85m **buying OriCiro Genomics, which is now called Moderna Enzymatics**. A press release said \"we obtain best-in-class tools for cell-free synthesis & amplification of plasmid DNA\" \\[Note: And ***they\u2019re quietly working on their mRNA-coding-for-a-enzyme business***, which if they succeed could quite ***possibly play a huge part in Moderna\u2019s future***\\]\n\n1. A 27Mar24 Pod.. at2hr11min shed a little line on what that means .. \"*Most of the \\[manufacturing\\] process for most of \\[Moderna\u2019s\\] life was chemistry based enzymatic, not cells, & the first steps were still using cells to make the plasmid & through the OriCiro acquisition* ***we removed that so we can go 100% synthetic***\"\n2. Bancel in a 04Jan23 FiercePharma article **described the technology** as \"*a critical upgrade in the conveyor belt like path that is Moderna's clinical development\" giving them \"faster product to clinic, faster product to market.. And then the research part is: We can iterate much faster*.\" **Essentially, every drug that they will ever produce through their platform will benefit from this highly strategic fit, in terms of accuracy, speed & cost efficiency.. Seriously, quite the acquisition**!\n3. For perspective, I'm guessing traditional pharma are still using the old, but established, DNA cloning process (employing E.coli bacteria), which could take several days & requires purification afterward. While ***OriCiro\u2019s amplification process can take just a few hours, reducing Moderna's large-scale manufacturing time, apparently by, up to 30%***.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the above, **they created Moderna Genomics** to tackle what they call \"blue sky challenges.\" This division is \"developing, characterizing, & optimizing a toolbox of gene-editing medicines to achieve our mission of individualized gene therapies for \\[genetic disease\\] patients.\" Essentially, *they are looking to develop tailor-made systems targeting genetic mutations specific to a patient\u2019s genome, which they call \u201cn-of-one\u201d individualized genetic treatments*. I reckon another way of saying all this, is that ***they are looking to create a platform for gene editing***, reminiscent of their INT cancer treatment.\n\nModerna also has \"**Strategic Collaborators**.\" These are signed deals with specialists in their field:\n\n1. **Metagenomi** (02Nov21): Is a CRISPR gene editing company. The partnership will look to accelerate the development of in vivo gene editing therapeutics for serious genetic diseases (Note: \u201cin vivo\u201d means directly in the body, rather than older methods requiring laboratory work then back in the body). Metagenomi will offer up access to its gene editing tools while Moderna will bring the expertise in mRNA & LNP delivery technologies. *Moderna is interested in improving delivery mechanisms in gene editing with its mRNA technology*.\n2. **Life Edit Therapeutics** (22Feb23): Is focused on next-generation gene editing technologies & therapeutics. They announced a strategic R&D collaboration to discover & develop in vivo mRNA gene editing therapies. A Fierce Biotech 22Feb23 said \"Life Edit\u2019s gene editing platform includes a large library of base editors and RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs). The RGNs are smaller than other conventional nucleases\u2014such as those currently used for CRISPR-Cas9\u2014which could boost versatility for delivery.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy take on all this, goes back to **Bancel's comments** above on the **huge potential Moderna sees in gene therapies** (mRNA coding for enzymes, possibly a future income stream) & obviously does for cell therapies (It\u2019s current business of mRNA coding for missing proteins etc).\n\n1. *Currently Moderna is using mRNA to code for a missing protein, the idea is that you would perhaps need an injection once a month (perhaps more often, perhaps less). However,* ***using mRNA to code an enzyme to gene edit you could possibly permanently cure patients***.\n2. *Both treatments would significantly reduce future healthcare costs*, however the **gene edit would have a much more profound financial impact**.\n3. **What price is appropriate for a \u201cone & done\u201d treatment, quite likely $millions** versus an annuity like stream from a series of injections possibly over a life time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Moderna** clearly **recognizes the risk gene editing could have on its business**, **so decided to invest heavily in it itself**. Given that Crispr-Cas9 arrived back in 2012, yet it was only last year that UK & US regulators approved drugs based on Crispr technology (e.g. sickle cell), ***its clear that regulators are cautious but open to the technology***.\n\nSo **if Moderna Enzymatics & Moderna Genomics are successful** & Bancel is correct in **his 3-5yr forecast in getting possibly 40 drug prospects**\u2026.

The whole realm of mRNA research has been so accelerated by covid and has so much potential to solve a lot of medical problems. We\u2019re really just scratching the surface, but the sprint through covid was a huge step.\n\nMy problem, though, is I don\u2019t know how to invest in such a thing. For example, researchers at UCLA are making big gains on peanut allergies, but it\u2019s not like UCLA is a pharmaceutical company. How do you get in on the forefront of these things, or do you just buy Pfizer and hope?",

They are genuiely a data-centric, cloud native company well positioned to scale using AI.\n\n\r  \nWith regards to Moderna & AI, I though the following podcasts were informative: \n\n1) 13Nov23 \"**Moderna harnesses AI to transform medicine**\" (22mins) \n\n2) 25Jan24 \u201c**AI and the COVID-19 Vaccine: Moderna\u2019s Dave Johnson**\u201d (20mins) \n\n3) 15Feb24 \"**Moderna and drug discovery with AI**\u201d (36mins). \n\n4) **For true depth**: On Moderna's website, their **08Nov23 Digital Investor Event.** It is all about digital/AI. The presentation is impressive, however I recommend watching the webcast as it's  way better than my ramblings below!.... The p34 video link on INT, from design to production, I challenge anyone to not find this JUST AMAZING! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, as much as they use AI, **for me it's just as important that they are digital & since inception have been a cloud native**. By this I mean, **consider their centralized technology platform** (\"the Goose\") with their \"apps\" being mRNA drugs (\"golden eggs\"), which incidentally are entirely designed in silicon on a computer (A, T, C & G rather than zeros & ones!). \n\n\\- For example, typically **Old Pharma requires a sample** **of a virus** to create a vaccine, while **Moderna**\u2019s mRNA technology doesn\u2019t require a virus, **just the genome sequence**. I don't believe the Covid virus was ever on site, there was just no need for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause this platform has digital characteristics, **the more it is used, the more data it collects, & thus, the more accurate & powerful its future results become**. These \"**Data Assets**\" I've seen referred to several time as **it's competitive advantage** \\[an example I heard was along the lines of, what Google does looks simple / basic, however what stops effective competition is their 25+ years of search data.. same idea here with Moderna's 10+Yrs of data!\\].\n\n**Learning continuously from clinical trials\u2019 data helps de-risk the pipeline** and, ultimately, **leads to a higher approval rate**.. In Moderna's hands, mRNA is a digital product, a digital medicine, if they can get it to work for one \"indication\" \\[BB:= medical condition\\], then they can change the code that they put into that & apply it to something else. \n\nFrom the 25Jan24 pod referenced above:\n\n1)  at15.40 We were very **thoughtful about how we built this digital landscape such that we're collecting structured data** across all these \\[scientific\\] steps **& turned this hard earned knowledge into algorithms** \\[i.e. To speed up development, improve accuracy/efficiency\\]. \n\n2) at4.50 For our mRNA sequence design, we're coding for some protein but there's a huge number of potential nucleotide sequences that could code for that & you have to try & figure what is the ideal way to get there. **We have algorithms that can do that translation in an optimal way** & we have **others that can then optimize it even further to make it better for production or to avoid things that we know are bad for this mRNA in production or for expression** \\[aka doing its job\\]. So, scientists just press a button & the work is done for them!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd AI isn't just used for drug research... \n\n1) 03Nov21 Pod at3.20 We constructed a manufacturing suite (\"**An AI engine**\") that allows our **scientists to order mRNA through online digital tools** & use **AI algorithms** to help automate this into a high throughput, massively parallel, highly automated, small-scale manufacturing facility to provide it\n\n 2) 25Feb21 Pod at31.15 We use the \\[manufacturing system\\] **to help predict yield or tell the scientist about their sequence**, how easy/difficult it is to produce & **whether they can change some coding in the sequence** of the mRNA to produce the same protein.. It's important that you have **the most efficient way in producing those mRNA.**\n\nOverall, **their AI embedded withing drug design & their manufacturing processes** have been credited with r**educing their cycle time down** from Old Pharma's **6-8yrs to 2yrs** in terms of the entire process they go through for drug development. Which im**plies greater capital efficiency over time**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So......** **What came first, the Chicken or the Egg?:** \n\nWith Moderna, **the PLATFORM came first** (way before Covid came along) **& through it the drugs were created**. The **platform is Moderna's competitive advantage, its moat**..... Old Pharma & other modern mRNA comps can undoubtedly make great drugs, however in my view **they can't compete without its 10+yrs of data assets feeding into its AI/digital platform**.. That's why I'm an investor!\r  \n",

        "post_text": "Your Thoughts on Moderna ($MRNA)??? Moderna currently has a PE of 5.4, they made $4.7 billion last quarter (beating estimates of $4 billion), they have $21 billion in advance purchase agreements for Covid vaccines in 2022, they have \\~$18 billion in cash to $650 million in debt, they have a current net profit margin of \\~52%, they have a highly effective vax that has now been approved by the FDA for children......aaaaaannnnnd they have no other products besides their SPIKEVAX.  Murky waters?  \n\nObviously a huge part of the buy thesis rests on how pervasive Covid continues to be and the need/demand for future boosters.  I personally think Covid won't go away and we will continue to need Moderna's vaccine booster into the future.  Remember, their product is one of the most effective and also isn't as challenging from a storage/shipping/administration standpoint as the competitors.  However, with 67% of the US population already vaccinated, I don't think it's likely that the deniers/unvaxxed are likely to jump on Moderna's product in the future. What does this mean for the longer-term profitability of the SPIKEVAX and can the market grow?  \n\nThe next buy argument is that Moderna has proven the efficacy and potential of MRNA vaccines. Moderna is positioned to use their industry leading knowledge (and $18 billion cash pile) to develop new vaccines for other maladies.  Currently $MRNA has Phase Three vaccine trials underway for cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the flu.  Any one of these gaining approval would be a huge boon for profits and for the stock price.  Phase 3 Trials typically take 1-4 years and how likely one (or all) of these trials are to hit is beyond me.\n\nThe bear case is pretty obvious.  Moderna is a one-hit wonder and their only product may be running out of disease to treat.  While MRNA vaccines were effective for Covid, they haven't (yet) proven to be successful for anything else.  It's a value trap and Moderna may not be able to create any future vaccines.\n\nPersonally, I lean more towards the bull case.  I think MRNA vaccines are a huge leap forward in medical technology and I have faith that Moderna is well positioned to profit off of this medical revolution.  With that said, I'm a newbie on biotech stocks, I don't currently have a position in $MRNA, and I'd love to hear from folks more knowledgable than me.  Thanks all!",

The stock jumped about 9% on Wednesday following a report that the FDA would soon approve the vaccine, removing the emergency use authorization under which it has been distributed since late last year.\n\n\nAnother vaccine maker, Moderna, reported better-than-expected results Thursday morning and announced a $1 billion share buyback. Investors are never happy: the stock traded down about 2% afterward.\n\nAnalyst sentiment on BioNTech is decidedly cool. Of 12 brokerages covering the stock, eight have a Hold rating and the other four are evenly split between Buy and Sell ratings. The stock trades at around $392.50, more than double the median price target of $184.11 and just $6 (1.5%) below the high price target of $398.44.\n\nFor the second quarter, analysts expect BioNTech to report revenue of $3.88 billion, up 61.4% sequentially and 91% above the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS are forecast at $8.96, up 74% sequentially. In the second quarter of 2020, the company posted a loss per share of $0.38.

Let us help each other Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.\n\nWe all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called \u201cPlays\u201d this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!\n\nPlease try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:\n\nMy 5 as a Day Trader:\n\nRKT \u2013 This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar\n\nUWMC \u2013 This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents\n\nTIGR \u2013 This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)\n\nCPNG \u2013 I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)\n\nCRSR \u2013 I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)\n\nThese are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore\n\nBILL \u2013 This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100\u2026 I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it\n\nMRNA \u2013 I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100\u2026\n\nSE \u2013 I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus\n\nCMG \u2013 OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares\u2026 What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????\n\nZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!\n\nI hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.",

        "post_text": "Buys for Pharma Stocks to Hold Long $GILD, $MRNA, $ADPT All with solid consistent growth since the crash in March, all very in the running for vaccines and medicine for COVID with $GILD leading the way for all pharma stocks in the race with human testing on severe cases of COVID already underway in Japan.\n\nStatistics for $GILD of 100% chance for future pre-trial human testing and 60% chance of stockpiling for future need.\n\n\\-\"Healthcare strategist Karen Andersen, who covers Gilead Sciences for Morningstar, assigns a 100% possibility that the drug will be approved and a 60% probability that the drug will be used for stockpiling.\" -Morningstar\n\n\\-\"We see imminent emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration and full FDA approval by mid-year,\" Andersen said.\n\nIn addition, $GILD has been bouncing (spiking) off the 200MA after breaking out through the 50MA consistently since the crash and is due for a big bounce early next week, along with a ton of positive volume at close on Friday. Significant support at the 200MA with low risk of scared selling because of the promising future with the vaccine.\n\n$MRNA showing great growth this week and no signs of stopping. Up >10% in my portfolio and only signs of further growth. Both $MRNA and $GILD good long term holds, unless you want to try to play the spikes $GILD has been showing the past couple weeks.\n\n$ADPT is a sleeper for me, trading at \\~$30 with good fundamentals and what looks to be a good chance to be a breakthrough with early pre clinical and human trials moving forward.\n\nExperienced scientists working with BARDA confirm that we have never seen a first trial of a vaccine go through, always needing multiple trials. So that is something to keep in mind, however, we have also never had this many Pharmaceutical companies tackling the same virus in the same time period, so the probability of that happening is higher than ever in history.\n\nDepending on your available equity, I have $GILD and $MRNA equal for future growth, and $ADPT as a low risk medium reward with the small potential of high reward. Keep in mind at this point picking a pharma stock to be the ultimate winner of the COVID vaccine race is like picking 1 potato farm in Iowa to grow the best potatoes. Still a \\~relative\\~ crapshoot at this point.",

        "post_text": "MRNA in bubble?  \n\nMRNA current price: $193, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \\~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \\~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 \u2013 not bad. But clearly we\u2019re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \\[1\\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.\n\nThis price already seems too high though\u2026 depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \\[2\\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \\~75 bil (read: overbought) \\[3\\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they\u2019re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have \u201cplans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022\u201d\\[2\\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a \u201clong term\u201d supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring > 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?\n\nI don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna\u2019s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \\[4,5\\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven\u2019t YET got the vaccine never intend to: \u201cnearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them\u201d. \\[6\\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA\u2019s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )\n\nAnd the reason it\u2019s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \\~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \\~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.\n\nAnd furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that\u2019s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.\n\nIn Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. \u201cThe drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country\u2019s supply.\u201d \\[7\\] This article advocates caution because, at the time \u201cdata is scant\u201d. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.\n\nWhat started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \\[8\\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well \u2013 what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \\[9\\] \u201cExtraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.\u201d At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \\~1,200 healthcare workers, \\~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \\~800 did. Of the \\~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \\[10,11\\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: \u201c98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \\[0.09-0.39\\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \\[0.09-0.25\\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \\[0.14-0.42\\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \\[0.04-0.63\\] for early treatment.\u201d \\[12,13\\]\n\nRemember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there\u2019s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult\u2026\\[14\\]. What about Africa? Didn\u2019t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well\u2026 a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \\[15\\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \\[16\\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\][https://www.thequint.com/news/breaking-news/moderna-vaccine-approved-in-united-states](https://www.thequint.com/news/breaking-news/moderna-vaccine-approved-in-united-states)\n\n\\[2\\][https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/heres-how-much-money-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-could-make-from-covid-vaccines](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/heres-how-much-money-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-could-make-from-covid-vaccines)\n\n\\[3\\][https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/market-cap](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/market-cap)\n\n\\[4\\][https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441?utm\\_source=twitter&utm\\_campaign=contentshareicons&utm\\_content=article\\_engagement&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_term=040621#.YGyZ3Ln8tHN.twitter](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=contentshareicons&utm_content=article_engagement&utm_medium=social&utm_term=040621#.YGyZ3Ln8tHN.twitter)\n\n\\[5\\][https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371665/covid-vaccine-side-effects-moderna-pfizer](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371665/covid-vaccine-side-effects-moderna-pfizer)\n\n\\[6\\][https://time.com/5925467/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/](https://time.com/5925467/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/)\n\n\\[7\\][https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02958-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02958-2)\n\n\\[8\\][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251768/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251768/)\n\n\\[9\\][https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3765018](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3765018)\n\n\\[10\\][https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04425850](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04425850)\n\n\\[11\\][https://trialsitenews.com/argentinas-ivercar-ivermectin-carrageenan-study-shows-positive-results-targeting-covid-19/](https://trialsitenews.com/argentinas-ivercar-ivermectin-carrageenan-study-shows-positive-results-targeting-covid-19/)\n\n\\[12\\][https://www.onedaymd.com/2021/01/ivermectin-and-covid-19-review-updated.html](https://www.onedaymd.com/2021/01/ivermectin-and-covid-19-review-updated.html)\n\n\\[13\\][https://ivmmeta.com/](https://ivmmeta.com/)\n\n\\[14\\][https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/05/11/indian-state-will-offer-ivermectin-to-entire-adult-population---even-as-who-warns-against-its-use-as-covid-19-treatment/?sh=7cfefc7a6d9f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/05/11/indian-state-will-offer-ivermectin-to-entire-adult-population---even-as-who-warns-against-its-use-as-covid-19-treatment/?sh=7cfefc7a6d9f)\n\n\\[15\\][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795896/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795896/)\n\n\\[16\\][https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities)",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.\n\n# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**\n*****\n> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500\u2032s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.\n*****\n> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.\n*****\n> \u201cLook out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,\u201d Michelle Meyer, Bank of America\u2019s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. \u201cIt will take time for the \u2018hard\u2019 economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.\u201d\n*****\n> Weekend action?\n> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed\u2019s March policy meeting.\n*****\n> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. \u201cISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide \u201cearly insight\u201d into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n> Cutting forecasts\n> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n> \u201cThe level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including \u201cbond king\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n> The coronavirus outbreak\u2014or Covid-19 \u2014has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n> \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.\u201d\n\n> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3\u20134 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter\u2014possibly 2\u20133% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5\u20136%\u2014followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China\u2019s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government\u2019s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25\u20130.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy\u2014the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date\u2014may comprise 0.2\u20130.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$JD** \n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$TLRY** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$XRAY** \n> * **$SE** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$FOLD** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$STNE** \n> * **$BLDP** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$ALBO** \n> * **$MAXR** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$ITCI** \n> * **$FNKO** \n> * **$JWN** \n> * **$EPRT** \n> * **$VIPS** \n> * **$GTT** \n> * **$CORE** \n> * **$BNFT** \n> * **$LVGO** \n> * **$EVRG** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$EGRX** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$TGLS** \n> * **$ATRS** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$NWN** \n> * **$WVE** \n> * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n> **Target Corp.

On Friday, 10/22:\n\nDeutsche Bank's Emmanuel Papadakis initiated coverage of Moderna (ticker: MRNA) with a Sell rating on the shares and a target price of $225.\n\nThis is also while:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended booster doses of Moderna (MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) COVID-19 vaccines for certain groups.     \n\nThis triggered a massive selloff and the stock fell from $333 to a low of $317 that day, closing around $326 after multiple days of gains. My question is:\n\nWhy does MRNA fall even though there were generally favorable news for the stock that day? \n\nAs in, CDC endorsing took weeks of work while Mr. Papadakis was only a day thing.\n\nNow the stock is sitting at $345 gaining again today building on news starting from the CDC endorsement.\n\nWas this an inside job to cover their Short positions? I am completely baffled by the market response. I would love to understand how this scenario works from a financial (not speculative) perspective. Thanks!",

So far, there are only three buys I regret:\n\n3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I\u2019m optimistic for its long term because it\u2019s Intel, so I\u2019m holding it.\n\n2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn\u2019t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it\u2019s only 5 shares, but I\u2019m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.\n\n1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking \u201ceasy $15 at least.\u201d It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it\u2019s headed in? My stubbornness refuses to cut this loss, and a balanced portfolio that is gaining more than losing is allowing me to hold this share with the blind belief that it\u2019ll see 800 again.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday\u2019s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n> \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n> \u201cIf [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n> \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n> \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities.

In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n> Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n> First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak\n\n> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NIO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$FCEL** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$FDX** \n> * **$CRWD** \n> * **$HUYA** \n> * **$NBEV** \n> * **$BE** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$YY** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$MUX** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$TME** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$CVSI** \n> * **$ACRX** \n> * **$ACN** \n> * **$GES** \n> * **$WPRT** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$GIS**\n> * **$CPRX** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$DRI** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$ZTO** \n> * **$BAX** \n> * **$LEN** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$WSM** \n> * **$TCOM** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$REI** \n> * **$DBI** \n> * **$CTRA** \n> * **$GPL** \n> * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n> **NIO Inc.

Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss\n\n> * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.\n\n> * B/itcoin \u2014 which topped $52,000 this week \u2014 hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a \u201chighly speculative asset.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus\n\n> * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,\u201d she said.\u201d We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.\u201d Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid\n\n> * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.\n\n> * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer\u2019s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK\u2019s top court rules drivers are workers\n\n> * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company\u2019s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an \u201cagency\u201d that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, not employees.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice\n\n> * During Thursday\u2019s GameStop hearing, Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. \u201cI do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,\u201d Griffin added.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nxHmaP5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GIRwl9k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VbE1lLY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gGk8pg5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8AYKTCG.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yYi6DTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BRv9eiQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1SY4cN7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nYlYObU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jBrK42f/divical1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-deere-dropbox-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Deere (DE)** \u2013 The heavy equipment maker earned $3.87 per share for its fiscal first quarter, compared to a consensus estimate of $2.14 a share.

However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of \u20ac924.8 million, a significant decrease from the \u20ac472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.\n   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.\n      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.\n      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.\n\nNow, there are many long term potencials:\n\n* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.\n   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.\n* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.\n   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with \u20ac17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.\n* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.\n   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.\n   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.\n\nTo raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance. Given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from COVID-19 vaccine revenues, I want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the company's new drugs as well as the potencial for success. This will heavily influence my decision for investment, thanks in advance. Other thoughts are also open and welcomed!",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 1 , 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 1, 2021**\n\nStocks staged a remarkable rally Monday as the market celebrated another effective coronavirus vaccine and Treasury yields stabilized. Each of the major indexes gained more than 2% today after suffering one of the worst weeks since October. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.\n\nIn Washington DC, over the weekend, the House of Representatives advanced the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package without any Republican support. The bill includes an additional payment of $1,400 to Americans, $400 per week in augmented Federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in State, local, and tribal aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, with lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before the mid-March deadline when current Federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. \n\nThe Democrats are employing a process called reconciliation in order to get the stimulus bill passed without Republican support. Through reconciliation, Congress can enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. As a reminder, there is a 50/50 split in the Senate, but Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Vice-President, has the power to break a tie. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NIO is set to report earnings after the bell, this is one we are closely watching\n* Two new space stocks, Spire Global and Vector are set to join the market via merger. Space stocks have been very hot recently and Cathie Woods of ARK Investments is planning to release a space-themed ETF soon.\n* Construction spending increased by 1.7% to $1.521 trillion, according to the Commerce Department's monthly report for January, with that level marking the greatest since the start of the government series in 2002. \n* After pulling back along with the broader market, Bitcoin (BTC) went from low $43,000 to over $48,000 now. \n* Facebook (FB) signed up a string of German media partners on Monday to provide content for a local news product, but the publisher of the country's best-selling newspaper said it would not take part on terms it dismissed as derisory. After the recent situation in Australia, Facebook now has to sign new publishers for its platform.\n* Nio is planning to start exporting to Europe in the second half of 2021, CEO William Li said during a web conference, [cnEV Post ](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)reported, citing automotive media outlet Bitauto.com.\n* Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) target raised by Barclays from $113 to $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $125\n* DraftKings (DKNG) target raised by Benchmark from $66 to $69 at Buy. Stock currently around $61.50\n* Moderna (MRNA) target raised by Chardan Capital from $107 to $182 at Buy. Stock currently around $155\n* Micron Technology (MU) target raised by Barclays from $100 to $110 at Overweight. Stock currently around $91.50\n* Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) target raised by UBS Group from $174 to $228 at Buy. This is one has a lot of upgrades recently, check it out. Stock currently $168\n* NovoCure (NVCR) target raised by Miuzho from $150 to $175 at Buy. Stock currently around $149\n* Ulta Beauty (ULTA) target raised by UBS Group from $335 to $365 at Buy. Stock currently around $322\n\nThe four most dangerous words in investing are: **this time it\u2019s different.\u201d - Sir John Templeton (Last week was nothing more than a normal market mechanic, always important to stay calm and keep things in perspective)**",

Obviously if Moderna also starts buying up competitors and adding more scientists they could build even more.\n\n[Coincodex link](https://coincodex.com/stock/MRNA/price-prediction/)\n\n[Investors.com link on Moderna 5 year predictions](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/)\n\nWondering what your thoughts are on their current state are.\n\nMy thinking is since they did a great job with the jab, now that Covid is tapering off, they\u2019re on the cancer solution path. Test studies have show positive feedback and if they are able to pull this off, making cancer radiation a technology of the past, making ir public and welcoming insurance companies to invest with them, it could be huge.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on buying 50 or 70 shares with a long term buy and hold out?",

        "post_text": "$HGEN - short term COVID play with Phase 3 data release by end of march and 5-10x possible ROI Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \\*\\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab\n\n**What is it?**\n\nLenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered\u00ae anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID \u2013 patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nGM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don\u2019t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here\u2019s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What\u2019s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn\u2019t target the virus \u2013 it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\\\#variantagnostic)\n\nFrom the article: \u201cGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.\u201d\u2026  \u201cOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)\n\nFrom the article: \"Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM\u2010CSF might be a key feature of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010induced cytokine storm in COVID\u201019 patients\"\n\n**Does it work?**\n\nWe will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I\u2019ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more\n\n1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \\--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)\n2. An interim analysis of HGEN\u2019s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results \u2013 with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).\n3. Otilimab \u2013 a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF \u2013 recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab\u2019s chance of success\n4. Here\u2019s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \\[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\\]:  \u201cAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement\u201d\n5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)\n\nFunded and selected by the NIH \u2013 this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab\u2019s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial\n\n**Competition**\n\n\\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It\u2019s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted\n\n**COVID \u2013 getting worse**\n\nAs many of you might\u2019ve heard, COVID isn\u2019t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it\u2019s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.\n\nHow deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it\u2019s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here\u2019s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x\n\nGoogle cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here\u2019s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab\n\n**Partnerships**\n\n1.

Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \\[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\\]\n\n**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**\n\n**The Market**\n\nHere\u2019s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:\n\n1. Stockpiling \u2013 US and ex-US\n2. US market\n3. Outside the US market\n\nUS market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking\n\nOutside the US market:\n\n1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe\n2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))\n\n**Price forecasting:**\n\nConservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn\u2019t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.\n\nWith positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN\u2019s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.\n\n**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**\n\n$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock\u2019s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships\n\n**BONUS BONUS \u2013 CAR-T implications and more**\n\nLenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don\u2019t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID\n\n**Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don\u2019t want to downplay this, I think it\u2019s very promising and I\u2019m very bullish on it, but I\u2019m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There\u2019s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well. \n\nLenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.\n\n$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1\n\n**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**\n\nImo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.\n\nPOSITION: 1250 @ $16.30",

The suit targets the three biggest so-called pharmacy benefit managers, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum Rx, CVS Health\u2019s\n Caremark and Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts. All are owned by or connected to health insurers and collectively administer about 80% of the nation\u2019s prescriptions, according to the FTC.  The FTC\u2019s lawsuit also includes each PBM\u2019s affiliated group purchasing organization, which brokers drug purchases for hospitals and other health-care providers. PBMs sit at the center of the drug supply chain in the U.S. They negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and federal health plans. They also create lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions. The FTC has been investigating PBMs since 2022. \n\n> The agency\u2019s suit argues that the three PBMs have created a \u201cperverse\u201d drug rebate system that prioritizes high rebates from drugmakers, which leads to \u201cartificially inflated insulin list prices.\u201d It also alleges that PBMs favor those high-list-price insulins even when more affordable insulins with lower list prices become available.  \u201cMillions of Americans with diabetes need insulin to survive, yet for many of these vulnerable patients, their insulin drug costs have skyrocketed over the past decade thanks in part to powerful PBMs and their greed,\u201d Rahul Rao, deputy director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.  \u201cThe FTC\u2019s administrative action seeks to put an end to the Big Three PBMs\u2019 exploitative conduct and marks an important step in fixing a broken system\u2014a fix that could ripple beyond the insulin market and restore healthy competition to drive down drug prices for consumers,\u201d Rao continued. \n\n> The FTC said it also remains \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the role insulin manufacturers like Eli Lilly, Danish company Novo Nordisk and French drugmaker Sanofi  play in higher list prices, according to a release from the agency. The three companies control roughly 90% of the U.S. insulin market.",

        "post_text": "I went through the biggest 1,500 stocks by size one by one and picked out the 248 best. Here's the list: # LINKS AT BOTTOM\n\nThis is not a holy grail list, nor investment advice. It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 \"most consistent\", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the \"most consistent\" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for \"cheap\".\n\n# ***METHODOLOGY:\n\n1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to; ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias.\n2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later.\n3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y.\n4. The financial metrics I am analyzing; Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.\n   1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time.\n5. Now, the analysis;\n   1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.\n   2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.\n      1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+\n      2. Current & Quick Ratio >1\n      3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.\n      4. And an overall high R\\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each.\n6. Growth Adjustments:\n   1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \\*could\\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.\n   2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend.\n7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:\n   1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:\n      1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)\n      2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)\n      3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)\n      4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential\n   2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=\u222b\u2080^(y)  (g + 1)\\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is \"Years to full IRR\". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw)\n8. FOR THE \"MOST CONSISTENT\" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs; there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \\~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\\*\\*\\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it\u2019s possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock\n\nEdit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements. Interestingly enough, it's almost exactly the 2 STDEV percentile aka. 95% percentile.\n\nEDIT: PART 2; link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)\n\nI'll get straight to the point; I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly. Refined the list from the base 1,500 to just 248 that had the most consistent growth on; income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and share price ratios to each respectively. Any companies that showed a recession in growth or a decline in financials were immediately eliminated. The broad index does not discriminate between growing and declining companies, just on size so there's a solid amount of stocks that drawdown the performance of the underlying index, my effort is to \"refine\" the index to only contain consistently growing companies.\n\nI don't have enough time or space to show the analysis of each, and recommend anyone taking this list to research any given company themselves because I am not that qualified to blindly suggest any stocks.\n\nI will organize the list in a readable and easily navigable manner as much as one can for and index of 248 companies.\n\n\\*\\*In an attempt to take out all biases when picking each stock out, I evaluated them blind (not looking at the ticker or any information that would tell me what the company is, some of the results from this from types of stocks \\*not\\* chosen and types of stocks that \\*were\\* chosen to be on the list were slightly surprising and sort of interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here it is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Separated by Sector, then Market Cap in Descending Order:\n\n[~~248~~ 254 Stock List](https://imgur.com/a/k8yoHcj) image (mid resolution, not updated, better if using the google sheets & PDF links)\n\n\\*\\*\\*[Link to Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ScMIY7Aw23rKEjLMMxg43joPfl9zsuKGy-igCNgS-Uo/edit?usp=sharing)\\*\\*\\* THIS IS THE MAIN ONE\n\n\\*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Yk8AcAUmK5jSBYlcNON87coeReYL8mO/view?usp=sharing) of 254 base list (from 1,500, 1/6 size down)\n\n\\*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnBRV9M9ehUp7X0qYCiGRLjKHAA2d14l/view?usp=sharing) of 72 Most Consistent (from 254, from 1,500: 1/21 size down)\n\n\\*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZXBwhNK92U7yqH46hsMJy3TNIjLfsrRL/view?usp=sharing) of 38 Most Consistent Refined (from 72, from 1,500: 1/42 size down)\n\n[Link to THINKORSWIM watchlist](http://tos.mx/fUy0Klg)\n\n[TradingView watchlist](https://www.tradingview.com/watchlists/134344514/), curtesy of u/hello_laco\n\nDesmos graphing function for calculating full IRR, using PE & EPSG, [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qcnlosqzzm)\n\n\\*EDIT 2: I have adjusted the google sheet for 2 things: 1, the most consistent stocks are underlined (in fundamentals, regardless of price because you can't use price the same way as measuring consistency of financials). 2.

Thoughts?\n\nAlso I like UNH and have abput 6.4% portfolio in it now and have gained about 25% since adding it less than a year ago.\n\nThey say UNH new target is over $500 for high target and low is now $420 I think.  Should I add a little more to UNH?\n\nI have 6.4 % UNH, but tech (mostly faang) is 50% of my portfolio.\n\nOr is 6.4% too much for UNH?

I've seen at least 2 post today on reddit of people claiming that they are gonna pull their money out of the stock market due to consistent losses. Most of their holding are stocks that were once popular on reddit and more than likely they bought at the very top of the hype but that's not here nor there. The fact is that if you invest money that you don't need any time soon you can just ride the wave of losses.\n\nI'm personally living paycheck to paycheck and could definitely use the money I have invested but I keep trying to see that money as LOST already. Maybe not the greatest thing but I'm definitely not dependent on it and don't plan on using it anytime soon. There's a certain Game ticker that has lost me a ton of money these last 2 weeks and I haven't bat an eye because I'm not counting on that money. \n\nI know a lot of us have been and continue to be broke and when we hear people on reddit discussing a damn near certain winner you want to jump in and make some money. But the truth is most of the time it's either a Pump and Dump and more often than not these people are just wrong. \n\nSo my advice to  you is if you can't afford to invest money and not touch it for at least a year whether it goes up or down then just don't invest that money. You'll most likely pull out too soon and just lose money.",

If there are a handful of companies to invest in stock wise I would put UNH on that list because they are just so profitable and have over time proven to be a diligent company.

Piper Sandler said UNH can rally recently ([https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/this-health-insurance-behemoth-can-rally-more-than-20percent-says-piper-sandler.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/this-health-insurance-behemoth-can-rally-more-than-20percent-says-piper-sandler.html)). I believe UNH can rally big in the coming 2 years - and will possibly be better than investing in your typical ETF simply because small cap will hurt in the coming pseudo-recession. I say pseudo-recession because it will be hard to have a typical recession when there is still approx. 2 jobs for every 1 person. I know I am all over the place with this post but we will continue to have YOY 4% to 6% inflation for the next several years... Unless the Fed hikes 50 basis points literally monthly which they will not do. One more reason to love mega cap stocks like UNH. I feel like my vision is somewhat clouded because all I see is positive for UNH including the fact they have a *lower than most* PE ratio of 21.95 (unheard of these days - Eli Lilly for example is a pharmaceutical company and has a PE of 67.83). I should ask while I am on here it is just normal for health insurance companies to have lower PE? It appears Anthem and Humana also have low PE.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020.\n\n# **What could be \u2018shocker\u2019 economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.\n*****\n> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.\n*****\n> The market\u2019s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. \u201cI could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.\u201d\n*****\n> # It\u2019s the economy\n> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. \n*****\n> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday\u2019s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.\n*****\n> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product in the second quarter.\n*****\n> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.\n*****\n> For \u201ccar sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThey shut down in every major market. Even though they\u2019re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it\u2019s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.\u201d\n*****\n> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.\n*****\n> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.\n*****\n> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.\n*****\n> \u201cThis week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It\u2019s monumental.\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.\n*****\n> # Stimulus one-two punch\n> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed\u2019s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. \n*****\n> \u201cEven though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.\u201d\n*****\n> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.\n*****\n> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. \u201cThere have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.\u201d\n*****\n> Stovall said it\u2019s likely there will be a lower low. \u201cThe only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,\u201d he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.\n*****\n> # Credit un-crunching\n> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.\n*****\n> \u201cStress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed\u2019s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),\u201d noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GBtm0Ny.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLx1MR7.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/1R4lyRy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mtTslWK.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7RHTBUy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3mrVvS.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R1BOiXV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WTuO4fr.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/q0iWKbS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pnJXRXy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9T9bEYz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/qMxQyex.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Will the Fed\u2019s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?\n\n> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it\u2019s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\n> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.\n\n> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the \u201cmoney printing.\u201d Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. \u201cThe massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve\u2014in concert with fiscal stimulus\u2014surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,\u201d noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed\u2019s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed\u2019s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday\u2019s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets\u2014both stocks and bonds\u2014may be beginning to sniff that out.\n\n*****\n\n# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims\n\n> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one\u2019s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.\n\n> \u201cThe personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cThis is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.\u201d Per LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it\u2019s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.\n\n> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.\n\n> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We\u2019ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it\u2019s not because they\u2019re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.\n\n*****\n\n# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity\n\n> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.\n\n> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82\u2014besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants\u2014both retail investors and institutions\u2014and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.\n\n> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.\n\n> \u201cIn volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren\u2019t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,\u201d noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. \u201cImproving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.\u201d\n\n> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn\u2019t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.\n\n> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23\u2014including buying large amounts of corporate bonds\u2014are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank\u2019s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren\u2019t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market\n\n> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?\n\n> \u201cAlthough market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you\u2019d be down 27% per year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.\n\n*****\n\n# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying\n\n> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.\n\n> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Dow.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$RH** \n> * **$BB** \n> * **$VFF** \n> * **$CHWY** \n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$WBA** \n> * **$PAYS** \n> * **$TTNP** \n> * **$STZ** \n> * **$CALM** \n> * **$GNLN** \n> * **$CSU** \n> * **$CAG** \n> * **$MKC** \n> * **$RMBL** \n> * **$GPL** \n> * **$HEXO** \n> * **$PVH** \n> * **$DARE** \n> * **$CTEK** \n> * **$CYD** \n> * **$NVCN** \n> * **$LW** \n> * **$AYI** \n> * **$ICLK** \n> * **$ALPN** \n> * **$APOG** \n> * **$UNF** \n> * **$EAST** \n> * **$SMTS** \n> * **$CSSE** \n> * **$SCHN** \n> * **$LNDC** \n> * **$NG** \n> * **$RECN** \n> * **$EDAP** \n> * **$APTX** \n> * **$ASND** \n> * **$VRNT** \n> * **$MOTS** \n> * **$VERO**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g5GXYu6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Sm5LctR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.30.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qr7snKw.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/T3P5Zde.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.31.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2gmrJMw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.31.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SW9tal3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EMVEv8d.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jUrq9C5.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DDXmPgK.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rzMu8Tn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/G3f55Vs.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.3.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# RH $110.93\n> **RH (RH)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:20 PM ET on Monday, March 30, 2020.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.\n*****\n> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.\n*****\n> \u201cMost of the slowdown occurred in March,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cDo we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You\u2019re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n> \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n> \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n> \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,\u201d Krosby said. \u201cThat is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Annual Declines Are Rare\n\n> Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday\u2019s close, the S&P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n> \u201cA positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders\n\n> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$RAD** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$BBBY** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$CBSH** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$AMRN** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$LAKE** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$LOVE** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$KEY** \n> * **$SON** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$BLX** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$MUSA** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$BMI** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$SRC** \n> * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $102.76\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "Investing 300k in Dividend Stocks I'm approaching semi-retirement and would like to get some assurance of a regular income while I focus on developing more part-time income. But I need to make sure I'm getting a steady and safe stream of baseline income from my investments to take care of fixed expenses.\n\nWhat do you think of the strategy of selecting say, 10 of the top dividend stocks that are safe (good companies) and have a good track record on keeping or raising their dividends. For example, Verizon, Enterprise Products Partners, KMI, and others that pay upward of 6% or higher on dividends. I wouldn't distribute the 300k evenly across the 10 (or so) dividend stocks, but I would diversify to a great extent to protect myself from a company going under. That way, I'm getting high dividend returns even if the market takes a downturn (and hoping companies don't lower their dividends if that happens).\n\nI know it's not a 100% safe strategy, but what do you think? Bonds at 4-5% is a bit too low if I can make 6-7% or higher on dividend stocks and get some protection against a potential market downturn.\n\nI'd appreciate anyone's thoughts, thanks!\n\n**UPDATE:** Thank you for all of your thoughts! I think what I may end up doing is an ETF like VOO or VTI, and as it makes money, secure my profits so that when the market takes a downturn I've built up some profit to keep the steady stream of income coming in. So, every time VOO makes me say 5k, I pull that out and put it in a money market account. \"Skim off the top\" to keep from market downturns forcing me to potentially dig into the principal. Anyone like that idea? Stock market returns are just too high to not put the 300k there. So long as I build up a security blanket against downturns, putting the 300k in the S&P seems the best choice and taking profits regularly. And if ever I don't need the money and my side job is enough, I'll just leave the 300k in there. VOO has some risk, but is safe long term, just have to weather the valleys as they come.  \n\nD.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n> But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n> \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n> \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n> \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n> \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n> \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n> \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # News High for Net New Highs\n\n> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Breadth Booming\n\n> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n> October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # JPMorgan Chase & Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "Started Investing 9/2021 and Finally Break Even I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly.\n\nI never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...\n\nSince 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. **On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.** I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.\n\nOn 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. **Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD**.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.\n\nI wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.\n\nPortfolio and 2-year&YTD charts:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk](https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk)\n\n**===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================**\n\n**1)**  To reply to several comments below about\u00a0me deserve losing all my money,\u00a0 uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment\u00a0decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to\u00a0someone you don't even\u00a0know in\u00a0internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which\u00a0is highest ever they make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2)** To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:\n\n**UPST**\n\nPros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price\u00a0should be doubled at least if that happens.\n\nCons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.\n\nComments below questioned my oversized position\u00a0in UPST. I have large position\u00a0because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly\u00a0added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created\u00a0this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nI started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly\u00a0so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst\u00a0downgraded SOFI because \"personal loans are risky\", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.\u00a0\n\nPros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage,\u00a0compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.\u00a0 CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered\u00a0analysts'\u00a0 doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my\u00a0confidence\u00a0in SOFI.\n\nCons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE**\n\n**ZS, CRWD** are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:\n\nCompanies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)\n\nCompanies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)\n\nCompanies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly\u00a0revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.\n\nThat is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.\n\nI own **NET** even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET\n\n**IOT** is\u00a0very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have\u00a0a\u00a0large total addressable market. They\u00a0are the leader in their industry.\u00a0\u00a0What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it\u2019s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.\n\n**BILL** is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.\n\n**GLBE**\u00a0is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE\n\nAlso if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management\u00a0software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without\u00a0checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS**\n\n**TMDX**: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. \n\nTheir growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It\u2019s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.\n\n**HIMS**: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never\u00a0happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because\u00a0analysts criticized their sales and\u00a0marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.\n\nHealthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably\u00a0a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MELI**\n\nA stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low.\u00a0Stock analyst\u00a0Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.\n\n**DIS**\n\nI bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs\n\n**OPEN**\n\nI bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account \"operdoor2\" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: **TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3)** To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.\n\nI do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions\u00a0per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:\n\nI sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst\u2019s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on\u00a0Monday are green.\n\nToday ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from\u00a0 $155\u00a0just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.\n\nWhy I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It\u2019s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it\u2019s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth\u00a0stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD\u00a0price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. \n\nYesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking\u00a0(UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and\u00a0increased my shares of TSLA\u00a0and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row\u00a0\u00a0this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days.\u00a0To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA\u00a0shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.\n\nWhenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute\u00a0buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,\u00a0 I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it\u2019s $44.\n\nAlso post ER\u00a0overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation\u00a0stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD\u00a0last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.\u00a0 And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, January 11, 2022  \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022**\n\nAfter one of the wildest days I\u2019ve experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterday\u2019s momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.91%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05%\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02%\n* Sea Limited (SE): +6.01%\n* Albertsons (ACI): -9.56%\n* Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83%\n* Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14%\n* Amazon (AMZN): +2.40%\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we move through this year \u2026 if things develop as expected, we\u2019ll be normalizing policy, meaning we\u2019re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we\u2019ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that\u2019s just the road to normalizing policy.\u201d\n\nPowell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, \u201cIf we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.\u201d\n\nPowell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, \u201cWhat that \\[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we\u2019ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We\u2019re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it\u2019s a long road to normal from where we are.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, \u201cWe can affect the demand side, we can\u2019t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powell\u2019s speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. \n\nSteven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said \u201cWe\u2019re seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.\u201d\n\nRegarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, \"It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December\u2019s Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982.

I've been investing for 2.3 years now and am still up about 30% in those 2 years from my one time lump sum 2.3 years ago.\n\nMost of the time I have been anywhere from 10% to 70% cash so maybe my returns would've been higher but I was always worried about big downturns.\n\nWell I fear NOW is very different!\n\nI just can't stomach having my portfolio reduced to its principal amount and I'm deciding to call it quits while I'm still 15% per year up!\n\nI will maybe leave around 30% in things like UNH, VTI, and maybe some energy and materials.\n\nOther than that I want about 70% in cash for the short term.\n\nI feel we are easily going to 4000 in May or sooner and might even hit 2000 by July.\n\nI definitely don't see any all time highs in VTI this year.  I say VTI will be under 4000 end of year and then 2000 in 2023.\n\nThe positive thing is that we Accumulators will be buying at LOW entries!  \n\nSo after all the pain this summer and year I think... We will have great entry points!\n\nI look at thr next 2 years as \"the great cleansing\" in the markets.\n\nShake out all the crap and start over again much lower!\n\nMohammed El-Erian today said something akin to what I'm saying.

Yes. I feel it's definitely right this time though!\n\nI mean seriously ... Does ANYONE see anything getting better this year?

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.\n\nLast week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as \u201ctransitory\u201d and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.\n* \u201cMeme stocks\u201d continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!\n* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84\n* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $522 at Buy. Stock currently around $412\n* UPS target raised by Citigroup from $220 to $235 at Neutral. Stock currently around $215\n* The Gap (GPS) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $38 at Hold. Stock currently around $33.4\n\n\u201cSomeone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a **tree** a long time ago.\u201d - Warren Buffet",

        "post_text": "The New Normal - 25% of the S&P 100 companies are >70 RSI signaling \"overbought\" I typically watch the top 100 companies daily. I find it entertaining more than anything. I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.\n\nThe RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.\n\nIf you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.\n\nWe see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.\n\nI continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!\n\nEDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTICKER --- NAME --- SHARE PRICE --- RSI Value\n\nACN\tAccenture Plc          F\t286.63\t69.31095528\n\nAMT\tAmern Tower Corp\t248.56\t69.37330112\n\nBLK\tBlackrock Inc\t810.35\t69.6989941\n\nUPS\tUnited Parcel Srvc Cl B\t179.51\t69.90349866\n\nMSFT\tMicrosoft Corp\t260.48\t69.97840519\n\nGOOGL\tAlphabet Inc Class A\t2279.265\t70.16983523\n\nNVDA\tNvidia Corp\t639.7401\t70.3677927\n\nMDT\tMedtronic Plc          F\t125.44\t70.59726396\n\nALL\tAllstate Corp\t122.04\t70.47226611\n\nWFC\tWells Fargo & Co\t43.535\t70.6544173\n\nNEE\tNextera Energy Inc\t81.21\t70.71177907\n\nGOOG\tAlphabet Inc Class C\t2294\t71.17607361\n\nUNH\tUnitedhealth Grp Inc\t388.82\t71.55161476\n\nCOST\tCostco Wholesale Co\t372.42\t71.63217977\n\nTGT\tTarget Corp\t208.54\t72.83200563\n\nSBUX\tStarbucks Corp\t117.615\t73.02642901\n\nADBE\tAdobe Inc\t522.73\t73.29936593\n\nBRK/B\tBerkshire Hathaway\t271.97\t73.78546388\n\nSO\tSouthern Co\t64.88\t74.75283354\n\nHON\tHoneywell Intl Inc\t230.57\t75.63350296\n\nEXC\tExelon Corp\t46.03\t77.6415172\n\nPFE\tPfizer Inc\t38.585\t78.0424713\n\nDUK\tDuke Energy Corp\t100.72\t78.63564751\n\nORCL\tOracle Corp\t78.77\t79.62182981\n\nLMT\tLockheed Martin Corp\t391.41\t79.8498989\n\nLOW\tLowes Cos Inc\t207.15\t81.33604962\n\nHD\tHome Depot Inc\t326.16\t81.59148035",

        "post_text": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

There were plenty of blue chip type companies like UNH COST LIN UNP NEE etc that gave From 7% to 20% a year all along!\n\nSo don't just invest in the index if you're so worried!\n\nAlso another thing. Yes, from 2000 to 2010 VTSMX gave you a little over 1% a year return, but guess what??\n\nIf you had steadily added say $500 a month from 2000 to 2010 into VTSMX??\n\nYou ended up with a 24% CAGR!!!\n\nSo yes, you're best bet is to stay diversified, make the market at least 50% of your portfolio and sticking with solid companies and to CONTINUE BUYING all along!!\n\nEasy!!\n\nKeep the faith all!",

Hi there! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will try to keep this brief, but would really love to have some conversations with others about my allocation because I keep thinking myself in circles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently my portfolio is:   \n\n\n* Spy/Voo: 47% \n* VXUS: 15% \n* Target Date - 2055: 7%\n* SCHD:  5%\n* QQQ:  1%\n* Individual Stocks:  23% (3% Appl, 3% MSFT, 3% CRM, 3% ABBV, 2% Cost, 2% UNH, 2% JPM, 2% BRK.B, 2% WMT)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been targeting a portfolio that will have roughly: \n\n* SPY: 40%\n* Target Date: 30% \n* VXUS: 10%\n* ???: 15% \n* Individual Stocks: 5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Context, the VXUS will go down as my 401k invests into target date fund which is already 1/3 VXUS but I will use my personal brokerage to help rebalance as needed)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have held most of the individual stocks for quite a few years, its how I got started investing. They have all done well, luckily to some degree and some due to not touching for a few years. \n\nI have gone back and forth researching, and thinking myself in circles. I have considered just selling my positions in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc and buying QQQ to keep a large cap growth tilt but worry it is just chasing performance. \n\nI have considered heavily SCHD and AVUV; SCHD for the drip effect in my roth to let it accumulate tax free but just havent found a reason to have conviction given my timeline is 20-30 years. AVUV in theory sounds good, the short track record and the ability to stomach downturns of SCV at 10-15% of my portfolio is possible but there isnt a ton of data to back up the fund. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love others thoughts and opinions on this, I have been in a mental pretzel for weeks thinking about this.",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Oct 15, 2020. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 15, 2020**\n\nStocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. \n\nThe Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week\u2019s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAfter Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.\n\nMarket participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180 degree turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that \u201cgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details\u201d. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, \u201cI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.\u201d Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.\n* US jobless claims reached 898,000 which was higher than the estimates of 830,000.\n* Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) has cut power to around 33,000 customers to mitigate risk of starting a wildfire citing dry and windy conditions renew threat of fires.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) had a price increase by Deutsche Bank from $27 to $38 at BUY. Big increase in analyst sentiment, the stock trended upward today.\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raise from Mizuho from $116 to $125 at BUY. It opened low, but recovered throughout the day. Stock has been a monster lately. \n* Dell (DELL) had a price target raised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) from $70 to $80 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) had price targets raised by Citigroup (C), and Barclays from $285 to $300 at BUY, and $253 to $270 at EQUAL WEIGHT, respectively. Stock faded towards the end of the day, nevertheless bullish analyst actions.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $240 to $255 at BUY. (looking at this one for a possible bounce tomorrow)\n* Netflix (NFLX) had a price target raise by KeyCorp from $590 to $634 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $500 to $560 at BUY. This is the third price boost this week, this stock is a monster!\n* Peloton (PTON) had a price target raised by BofA Securities (BAC) from $116 to $150 at BUY. stock is at All Time Highs today... insane, an absolute monster!\n* Replimune Group (REPL) had price target increase by BMO Capital, SVB Leerink, and Barclays from $40 to $51 at OUTPERFORM, $27 to $44 at OUTPERFORM, and $29 to $50 OVERWEIGHT, respectively. This thing is squeezing, up 60% in the last two days!\n* Take-Two (TTWO) had a price Target raise by Morgan Stanley from $176 to $185 at OVERWEIGHT\n* United Health (UNH) had a price target raise from Piper Sandler, Raymond James, SVB Leerink, Oppenheimer and Royal Bank of Canada. On average its a $380 price target at OUTPERFORM, this has been a monster stock!\n* Zoom Video Communications (ZM) had myriad of price target increases, including from Wells Fargo (WFC), Royal Bank of Canada, Piper Sandler, $375 to $465 EQUAL WEIGHT, $450 to $600 OUTPERFORM, and $411 to $501 NEUTRAL. Very bullish analyst action.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) reported better-than-expected results in Q3 earnings. Stock was 1.26% up at the time of writing\n   * EPS of $1.59 vs $1.28 estimate \n   * Revenue of $11.6 billion vs $10.61 estimate\n* Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported slightly better-than-expected earnings. Stock outperformed the market, up 3.96% at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.51 vs $0.47 estimate\n   * Revenue of $2.45 billion v $2.43 billion estimate\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported much better-than-expected earnings, especially in EPS. Stock was 0.9% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.98 vs $0.92 estimate (wow!!!)\n   * Revenue of $12.4 billion vs $11 billion\nEdit: figures on TSM are now correct\n\n\u201cLife is not about finding yourself.

The fallout has wreaked havoc across the U.S. health-care system. Change Healthcare offers e-prescription software and tools for payment management, so the interruptions left many providers temporarily unable to fill medications or get reimbursed for their services by insurers.\n\nUnitedHealth said on Monday that it began releasing medical claims preparation software, which will be available to thousands of customers in the next several days. The company called it \u201can important step in the resumption of services.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, UnitedHealth said it restored Change Healthcare\u2019s electronic payments platform, after rebooting 99% of its pharmacy network services earlier this month. It also introduced a temporary funding assistance program to help health-care providers experiencing cash flow trouble because of the attack.\n\nUnitedHealth said the advances will not need to be repaid until claims flows return to normal. Federal agencies like the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have introduced additional options to ensure that states and other stakeholders can make interim payments to providers, according to a release.\n\nA survey published by the American Hospital Association on Friday found that 94% of hospitals have experienced financial disruptions from the Change Healthcare attack. More than 60% of the 1,000 hospitals surveyed estimated the revenue hit to be around $1 million per day. Responses were collected between March 9 and March 12.\n\n\u201cWe continue to call on Congress and the Administration to take additional actions now to support providers as they deal with significant fallout from this historic attack,\u201d AHA CEO Rick Pollack said in the release.\n\nThe Biden administration announced Wednesday that it has launched an investigation into the company due to the \u201cunprecedented magnitude of the cyberattack.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights is carrying out the inquiry. The OCR enforces the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2019s security, privacy and breach notification rules, which most health plans, providers and clearinghouses are required to follow to protect health information.\n\nUnitedHealth hasn\u2019t disclosed what kind of data was compromised in the attack, or whether it cooperated with the cyber threat actor in order to restore systems. The company said it\u2019s been working closely with law enforcement and third parties like Palo Alto Networks and Google Cloud\u2019s Mandiant to assess the breach.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/unitedhealth-group-paid-more-than-2-billion-to-providers-after-attack.html",

Maybe 5 to 10%.\n\nThen I reenter and do it again.\n\nThis could also be done with a stock like aapl or unh or something.\n\nThis way I'm gambling with only 10% of my money and preserving 90% through a very volatile period that most see in 2023s first half at least.\n\nEither that or I just hold the (QQQ) with 10% and add little by little on large dips.\n\nSo I'm effectively preserving my 90% (Maybe that's a bit high!\u013a) and then only 10% is \"sloshing around\".\n\nIf we go down 30% eventually ( by February or March 2023) then I move more into QQQ .

I put the proceeds (they were all long shares) in PG for the new year.\n\nAnalysts are saying that PEs will contract this year as the FED raises rates and that things like NVDA will take a big hit.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still long NVDA and my cost basis is $127 and it's still 3% of my portfolio, but I feel the share price WILL go lower and if it hits 200 to 230 or so I'll probably add some more shares.\n\nAlso, analysts are predicting things like consumer staples will fare well this year and so I thought a nice balance would be to add some PG for a little stability.\n\nI've also got things like UNH HD SHW ODFL TMO and NEE, but feel we may correct 10 to 20% towards February or March.\n\nI'm about 40% MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA and ASML and a little CRWD and PYPL recently purchased after their beat downs.\n\nI'm 20% cash also waiting for the sell off!\n\nGood luck all and Happy 2022!",

Especially $HUM Im not an expert on the healthcare industry but i do know healthcare and health insurance costs are a voting issue and we are in a election year.\n\nHumana today reported earnings and are anticipating higher costs. Set the expectations low so when you beat, it looks better and you get paid a bonus.There is roughly 66 million people(voters) currently on medicare alone. According to google. 92.1 percent of people, or 304.0 million, had health insurance at some point during the year.I think democrats and republicans pass some sort of legislation before the election that helps lower the cost and that benefits the healthcare companies.Cigna reports tomorrow, we'll see what they say.$HUM is oversold. I can see it bouncing back to $400 in the next few months. The Health insurance industry is literally never going away.\n\nI also think AI will make the health care industry much more efficient and the insurers much more profitable. ",

Ok guys I've been thinking tonight again!\n\nI've come to the conclusion after many hours of pondering the subject that .... There is absolutely NO PURPOSE to being in the market at very least 2022 and most likely 2023!\n\nI just can't see any of this getting better any time soon!\n\nTomorrow I will increase my SQQQ position size and the only stocks I will hold will be a few oil and maybe WMT! At least till 2024 or so!\n\nI am going to cut my losses and get out while I'm ahead from my first 2.4 years investing! Yes, I'm still up a measly 18% for 2.4 years, but it's better than being 0 or less as we go down further.\n\nI believe we may have a relief rally soon but in my opinion in won't amount to much. Maybe 1 or 2% portfolio up.\n\nThen I'll exit to maybe 60% cash at least.\n\nI hate to say this but I had a vision last night of the market getting down to about 2000 or so and not recovering till maybe 2024.\n\nWhat I'll do is buy back in a little here and there at about 3000 or less on sp500.\n\nI feel we should all be very careful now and preserve as much cash as possible.  All my new savings have been going directly to money market and is not entering the market. There is no point. All miney that enters now will just get gobbled up as we fall.\n\nThat's just my opinion, but on a serious note I just don't see ANY good in markets this year.\n\nIf you do please enlighten me. I just don't see it, but I am only a layman.\n\nSo my brothers, please be very careful. The only stocks I'll purchase after we hit 3000 or less will be things like MSFT AAPL GOOGL and maybe NVDA mostly.\n\nAlso I believe in UNH TMO SHW and HD.\n\nI will also be purchasing some VTI once we hit 3000 or so as I believe that is a good entry point.\n\nStay safe all and remember that in a couple years I have hope that things will eventually get better if even only slightly.\n\nUse this oppurtunity to purchase our equities at a large discount! But in my opinion right now is TOO SOON! The market has more purging to do!.... A lot more!\n\nPeace and keep the faith! Things will get better some day!",

I was using a compound interest calculator (an old freeware version I had) and I decided today to look at some WORST (well reasonably worst I believe) case scenarios using low savings rates and being FULLY invested (no cash) and continually investing all along.\n\nI used a very manageable (in most people's cases I would assume) small sum of $200 a month.  I wanted to use extremes for my point and figured $200 was something even people with tight budgets could afford.\n\nSo I started with an initial $50k investment.  Some may start with only $5000 or $10000 or $0 it doesn't matter.\n\nSo I also dialed in an interest rate of only 3% assuming a very low rate of return.  It's still not beating inflation in real terms but is what it is. Again these are imo worst case scenarios.  For all I know the sp500 could be at 2500 5 years from now but I would hope not.\n\nSo with a starting initial deposit of $50k and $200 a month after 5 years I ended up with $70706. Deposits of $12k over those 5 years and interest of $8706.\n\nIf I changed the contribution rate to $433 a month or $5200 a year I ended up with $85550 after 5 years.\n\nSo assuming the sp500 is at 4100 now and the 5 year return is 15% total the sp500 would be at 4715 5 years from now.\n\n\nI would assume this is a very worst case scenario.\n\nFor example a lot of my portfolio is in names like MSFT AAPL and UNH etc.  I'm sceptical that those stocks will only return 15% total in 5 years.\n\nSo I think it helps to have maybe 50% in something like VTI and maybe the rest made up of blue chip large caps like MSFT GOOGL AAPL NVDA ASML UNH HD SHW etc. Maybe only 10 to 15 or so stocks total.\n\nSo my advice is to keep investing and to think 5 years out and ignore all the short term noise.\n\nYes, I'm currently almost 50% cash and looking for a 3500 entry point into VTI to begin adding, but the easiest thing would probably be to just keep adding into VTI regularly and ignore everything!",

SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%.

        "post_text": "Coca Cola ($KO) vs Pepsi ($PEP): Are Either Worth Buying Right Now? Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. \rA famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.\r  \n\r\r  \nSo, which company is the better investment choice?\r We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?\r  \n\r  \nHistorically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.\r\n\n# Latest Earnings \n\nAt the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. \rMeanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. \r\n\n# Valuation Metrics\n\nPepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6. \n\n# Margins\n\nThe small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.\r \n\n# Capital Structure\n\nThe capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \\~$250B and debts of \\~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B). \r  \n\r  \nHowever, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.\n\nSince that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.\r\n\n# Dividends \n\nCoke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.\r  \n\r  \nThat's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list.\r Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%. \r  \n\r  \nAt this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.\r\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nNow, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.\n\n# Price Targets\n\nMy personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. \rThe [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.\r\n\nOn the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. \r[Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nNow, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. \n\nThat's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?\r  \n\r  \n**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**",

It\u2019s also really hard to sell when something you own is on a crazy run and FOMO creeps in.\n\nThe key success here is don\u2019t get greedy.   Take your profits and protect your capital core.  Every stock is different and nothing is ever a sure bet.  Lululemon used to be a really strong buy but took a huge dip a few years back because of allegations against the founder\n\nMy average annual return is 20%.  It\u2019s not as sexy as making infinite gains on shorts but it means I will retire a lot sooner than I thought I ever could.  If one of my tickers hits bigger than I thought I reassess value and often I take my book value and use the gravy to ride that train the rest of the way\n\nIf you could afford to invest $1k per year you could retire w over a million, and way more if you can increase your annual investment more each year.\n\nCompound interest at a rate of return of 20% after\n20 years = $275k ($20k invested @ $1k per year.\n25 years = $775k ($25k invested @$1k per year).\n30 years = $1.3M ($30k invested @$1k per year).\n\nAfter 30 years you could retire and earn an annual income of $78k with a passive 6% interest without eroding that core $1.3M.\n\nStart small and be patient.

I don\u2019t want to mislead.\n\nThe point of this post was not to say 20% forever is easy or hard or that everyone should expect that.  The point is to protect your capital and take small risks to learn and build.\n\nFigure out how much pre-tax $$ you need to live every year and divide that by 5%.  That\u2019s what you need to retire.\n\nAlso thank you to all the great comments and awards!  Sweet dreams xo",

I have been finding out about the balance sheet, income statement and cashflow statement. To get a bit of a hang of the metrics that come from these, I am now comparing 2 industry giants: Pepsi and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe numbers below are from a 2006 - TTM timeframe. For example: between 2006 and today (TTM), PEP revenue grew 146%:\n\n||PEP|KO|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Dividend CAGR|8.34|2.08|\n|Dividend Yield|2.9|3.4|\n|MarketCap|142|143|\n|Revenue|146|79|\n|Revenue CAGR|5.37|3.42|\n|Net Income|41|107|\n|FCF|43|109|\n\nI have a few questions about these numbers:\n\n* PEP seems to be the stronger company, with a revenue that grew a lot more than KO's. However, where PEP net income only grew 41%, KO's grew 107%. What is -generally speaking- the meaning of this? Does it mean that KO is running a much more efficient operation?\n* Marketcap of both companies grew basically the same: up \\~140% over the last 17 years. But revenue growth of PEP is a lot bigger than KO's. Would that mean that either KO is overvalued right now, or PEP undervalued (compared to one another)?",

That **beat the 8.2% average estimate** of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nFor the full year, the Atlanta-based company now sees **organic revenue growth of 12% to 13%,** up from its **previous estimate of 7% to 8%.** That\u2019s despite an **expected negative currency impact of 9%.**\n\nEarnings were **70 cents a share** in the period, excluding some items. Analysts were looking for **67 cents**, on average.\n\n\nChief Executive Officer James Quincey said the results reflected \u201cthe actions we\u2019ve taken to execute for growth in the face of challenges in the operating and macroeconomic environment.\u201d The company said it raised prices 12% on average across its products.\n\nCoca-Cola continues to gain market share for its ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverages. The maker of brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid has benefited from consumers returning to much of their pre-pandemic behavior after Covid restrictions were lifted.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s chief rival, PepsiCo Inc., said two weeks ago that it also passed on an **average product price increase of 12% to consumers** during the second quarter, and it increased its **full-year organic revenue growth forecast to 10% from 8%.**\n\n[Source: Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/coca-cola-tops-sales-estimates-on-higher-prices-raises-guidance?srnd=premium)\n\n----\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp. reported sales that topped estimates as consumers continue eating out despite higher prices. \n\nThe closely watched measure of **same-store sales rose 9.7%** in the second quarter compared with a year ago, the company said Tuesday. **Analysts were looking for a gain of 7.5%**, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. **Sales at US stores open at least a year climbed 3.7%,** while analysts projected a 3% increase. Adjusted profit also surpassed estimates, coming in at **$2.55 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.46**.\n\nThe Big Mac seller said US sales growth was helped by strategic price increases and value offerings. The company had said in April that some diners were trading down to less expensive menu options. The popularity of digital sales, including the mobile app and delivery, so far appears to be offsetting pressure consumers are facing from decades-high inflation.\n\nThe chain has largely been a winner during the pandemic due to its drive-thru lanes. **Digital sales** are also growing, topping** $6 billion in the quarter in the top six markets**, accounting for almost a** third of their total sales.**\n\nMargins have been under pressure across the industry because of supply-chain problems and wage increases. McDonald\u2019s said its** total restaurant margin rose 3% in the quarter, or 8% excluding currency translation.**\n\n[Source: Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/mcdonald-s-sales-top-estimates-on-price-hikes-value-offerings?srnd=premium)",

        "post_text": "Tesla Investors Voice Concern Over Elon Musk\u2019s Focus on Twitter The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2018s involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company\u2019s stock on track for its worst full-year performance.  \n\n\u201cThere is no TSLA CEO today,\u201d Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. \n\nMr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla\u2019s stock Monday. Shares in the world\u2019s largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company\u2019s former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.\n\nMr. Black said, \u201cThe market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla\u2019s brand equity.\u201d\n\nRoss Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla\u2019s board of directors. \u201cWho is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,\u201d Mr. Gerber said. \n\nHe separately tweeted, \u201cThere is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon\u2019s plans are.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. \u201cI expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,\u201d he testified. \n\nTesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla\u2019s stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.\n\nTesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world\u2019s wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla\u2019s stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.\n\nThe Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: \u201cTesla will be great long-term, but doesn\u2019t control macroeconomic tides.\u201d He later added \u201cI will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,\u201d but didn\u2019t offer details.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. \u201cI continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,\u201d he tweeted Saturday.\n\nBill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk\u2019s purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company\u2019s mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\nLeo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: \u201cTesla board is missing in action\u201d and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. \n\nMr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn\u2019t signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. \n\nTesla\u2019s brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7",

        "post_text": "$KO Balance Sheet Discussion I've been spending a lot of time looking at company debt lately and I decided to take a look at Coke Cola's balance sheet. A couple things stood out. For one, Fidelity lists their current assets at over $97 billion and their current liabilities at over $69 billion. While that doesn't look too bad on the surface (higher than I'd like, but still), I decided to go look a little deeper. It seems as of the end of 2022, over 1/3 of their assets were listed as goodwill and other intangibles, which to me means the only thing that elevates their company's assets over their liabilities is what they estimate the \"Coke Cola\" brand names to be worth, along with whatever else they consider to be intangible assets. I like to look at goodwill because I often take it with a grain of salt.   \n\n\nWhat do people think about this? Feel free to double check what I'm seeing, but despite it being one of the great American brands, I found it kind of alarming. Also, why do they have so much debt? With their cash flows it seems like it shouldn't be necessary. Anyone know the history here?  \n\n\nIt's kind of alarming to me how much debt sits on a lot of corporate balance sheets, even with companies many would consider blue chips, but that's a topic for another thread I guess. I get the idea of leveraging debt, but man, a lot of these companies have a ton of it.",

        "post_text": "Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package  Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker\u2019s board.\n\nTesla\u2019s shareholder meeting is on June 13.\n\nThe report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk\u2019s pay package. Tesla\u2019s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk\u2019s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.\n\nISS said \u201ccautionary\u201d shareholder support was merited for Tesla\u2019s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla\u2019s board decided to reincorporate and over the \u201cunknown\u201d nature of Texas\u2019s business law framework.\n\nThe proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla\u2019s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.\n\n\u201cAt a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,\u201d ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.\n\nPay package push\n\nTesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory facility in Austin.\n\nTesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk\u2019s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk\u2019s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.\n\n\u201cOver the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,\u201d Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.\n\nTesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon\u2019s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.\n\nProxy advisor pull\n\nISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.\n\nThey\u2019ve also been the direct target of Musk\u2019s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they \u201ceffectively control the stock market\u201d on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called \u201cpassive\u201d or institutional shareholders.\n\nInstitutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.\n\nISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it \u201cremains excessive,\u201d noting that \u201cthe board has effectively only offered shareholders an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 option in this vote.\u201d\n\nThe proxy advisor alluded to Musk\u2019s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.\n\n\u201cThe grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board\u2019s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,\u201d ISS said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/31/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-pay-package-shareholders.html",

I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  \n\nI'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's \"this close\" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  \n\nThe first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  \n\nMy primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:\n\n**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG\n\n**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT\n\nThat was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\\*Mart)...  \n\nI'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

The GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone that signals to one\u2019s brain that they\u2019re full, according to UC Davis Health. The drug has also decreased some patients' cravings to eat foods with high sugar or fat content, though, CNBC reported, which could cause problems for some food brands that have decided in recent years to lean into snacking while marketing their food. Food chains and companies producing junk food were predicted to be potential losers of the weight loss drug boom because of the decreased appetite for unhealthy foods, Markets Insider reported last week.",

Ok, so yesterday I made a post about the indicies are heading towards their pre-pandemic levels (i.e S&P500 below 3400, Nasdaq below 10000) and I still hold this opinion that we're probably gonna see these levels in a couple of months. However I think the markets are oversold currently because Nasdaq dropped almost 1000 points in a week and at this rate we will see those pre-pandemic levels only within a month or 2 at max. But then what happens? I mean, recession in next year is quite possible but this means that the markets should continue to drop throughout the year. BUT  it can't continue to drop at this pace otherwise it will down a lot more than the pre-pandemic levels, at this rate we might be going back to 2015-16 levels this just seems absurd. I think markets are overreacting and oversold right now and I'm considering an entry for a short term position in a good company like $GOOG or $KO. Thoughts?",

        "post_text": "Which is the better stock to keep long term: Coca Cola (KO) or Verizon (VZ)? DD included Hi, investor newbie here (6 mo.). I want to trim the amount of individual stocks that I own as I believe I overdiversified my money. I own some shares in both companies and they are the least performing in my portfolio. I would like to sell one as I could use the money on a better performing stock that I have gains in (QCLN/AMD/APPL).  For what it's worth, I have a little more money invested in Verizon, than I do Coca Cola. Can someone help me figure out what's the better stock to keep between KO and VZ? After doing some DD, this is what I came up with:\n\n**The case for selling KO:**\n\nCoca Cola: I got into this last stock July for $48.80 and it's currently at $49.92, so there's been zero growth. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q3-2020), they haven't been doing well either. Their revenue is down 10% from a year ago and their gross profit has decreased as well. KO's balance sheet shows that their total assets have went up, but so has their debt. They have increased their total debt by 15%, which has decreased the total equity value of the company.\n\nKO has also tripled the amount of money purchased in investments (according to their cash flow sheet), leading me to believe that they have no plans to recover immediately and are playing the long term game.\n\n**My** **Conclusion:** The only case for keeping KO currently is because of their dividends and name recognition. The pandemic has really affected KO and will probably not recover until it's over. With that being said, other stocks are booming so it would be foolish to leave money here to trade sideways until the COVID is over.\n\n**The case for selling VZ:**\n\nThis stock has actually been in a steep decline for several months, since hitting their ATH in early December. I'm currently in the negative in this stock, which is insane giving that the stock market set a new ATH records across the 3 major indexes. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q4-2020), their net income is down 9.6% (their revenue only increase 1% for the year).\n\nLike KO, VZ has also increased their amount of debt, but only by 8%. Their total equity is good, as it has increased by 10% from the year prior. Their cash flow sheet shows that they've spent a lot of money in investment activities, but this is offset by the net cash they gain in the last year (10+%).\n\n**My Conclusion:**  The case for if I should keep VZ is a conundrum for me. Their financials show growth, but the value of their stock declining sharply during a record level boom market. They have a at great dividend (4.5%) but it is not enough to cover their stocks loss in value. It is concerning and selling this stock would incur a slight loss for me. However I could regain it back quickly if I took the money wasted here and invest it into another stock (PayPal for example).\n\n**TLDR:** I own both KO and VZ. I would like to sell one of these stocks to chase gains in growth stocks, while keeping the other long term. Which one should I keep?",

        "post_text": "Thoughts on buying KO (Coke) with Pepsi earnings coming up? Last earnings report, Pepsi had a spectacular earnings, and KO went up along because it was widely thought KO's earning would reflect what Pepsi had. Pepsi's earnings is this Tuesday pre market, and I was thinking about picking up KO on Monday as a short term play (a few months), but can evolve into a long term play depending on how things turn out. I have two main reasons:\n\n1. I think the earnings will beat again. More and more people are starting to go out not only in the United States, but also around the world. Restaurants have more people, movies have more people, travel, and many more.\n2. KO can pass inflation costs down to consumers. With high inflation uncertainty, at worst case, KO can just increase the price, and consumers will pay the price of inflation, and earnings will probably continue to increase. People may start parking their money into stocks that can make consumers front the inflation cost, so this would be good for KO\n\nThough one concern I have about a short term play is how hard are the supply chain issues hitting KO (if at all). The Pepsi earnings may have supply chain issues, which may rattle investors for KO alike. Though if this is the case, I think I'll just change my strategy to long, as I think it will be a \"safer\" stock to hold throughout the upcoming year, two, or three with inflation and Fed tapering / increasing rates.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Any other points that I should think about?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention why I'm buying KO instead of Pepsi outright, think KO has been hit harder than Pepsi in the recent weeks, so I think it is oversold.",

Historically, KO rises on average 5.47% during July-August (back to 2010). This makes sense considering the beverage market. Also looking at price action around earnings reveals that there tends to be a decline into earnings with a several dollar rise following. Chart also shows us teetering around a long term resistance turned support. With entertainment, travel, and dining all reaching pre-covid levels it would make sense that their earnings would follow suit. I have 100 AUG 20 57.5C that I plan on trimming as price rises. With a possible +800% at $60, it's really a no brainer to have a small stake in.

For the first time in forever they will be releasing new products to consumers such their own brand of sprinkling water known as AHA.

        "post_text": "My top 5 dividend stocks right now. What are yours? # How to pick dividend stocks\n\nA classic mistake that investors make when looking for dividend stocks is to just go for the biggest dividend yield. It makes sense, right? Get the most value for your money? Well, not really. This can actually be very misleading. Typically, the stocks with the highest dividend cannot sustain it. Some companies start squeezing as much cash as possible out of their operations, cutting costs, cutting corners to get that dividend to the shareholders. In the process, they bleed their business dry and they end up with a company that is in no position to grow. We don't want that. Personally, I like nothing more than a healthy business with good prospects paying a dividend. Most importantly, I want that dividend to be sustainable and I want companies to have a record of raising the dividend. I do **not** want companies that have lowered or suspended their dividend in the last ten years. This is not a foolproof method, but it increases the likelihood that you will get a company that pays a sustainable, growing dividend. Also, with these types of stocks, it is good to manage your expectations. Chances are that you will not see them double or triple in price over a few months like a hot tech stock, but instead you will get a reliable income year in and year out along with a modest price increase. Right? So,\u00a0in my opinion, these five dividend stocks are a great deal right now. However, before I share them with you, I want to ask you what are your favourite dividend stocks? Why do you like them? Let me know in the comments below.\n\n# Verizon Communications (VZ)\n\nOkay, so, first off, we have Verizon Communications. Verizon is a telecommunications company and they are currently focusing on building up their 5G capabilities and adoption. One of their flagship services is Fios which is a bundled fiber optic service that provides internet access, telephone and television services. Verizon's wireless network provides the broadest coverage in the industry although their 5G coverage is only half of T-Mobile's, but is still better than AT&T's. Essentially, they are a big, established telecommunications player and they are not going anywhere. Their price right now is decent. Currently, they trade\u00a0at a PE of 12.2 which has been pretty much typical for the company over the last 5 years and is normal for the industry. They also have a forward PE of 10.9, which is relatively cheap for Verizon so that's good to see. However, Verizon's best selling point right now is their dividend.\u00a0They currently offer a strong dividend of 4.49%, but the best part about it is that Verizon have raised it ***every single year*** in the last 10 years! Every single year! Plus, the average for the top 25% companies in the US by dividends is about 3.5% so Verizon is offering an above-average dividend for the US!\u00a0The dividend is covered by Verizon's earnings with the payout ratio being about 55% right now, but it is expected to drop to 49% next year. If you're not sure what the payout ratio is, it is essentially the dividends divided by the company's earnings so, with Verizon, we can see that they pay out 55% of their earnings as dividends. This is relatively high, but Verizon is a dividend company so a 50% payout ratio is expected and normal. Plus, Finbox's discounted cash flow model values Verizon at $72 while SimplyWallStreet values the company at an astonishing $150. I doubt it will go up that much, but my point is that Verizon is undervalued based on its free cash flow so that's another bullish argument for the company.\n\n# Kellogg (K)\n\nMy second favourite dividend stock right now is Kellogg, a classic consumer staples stock. As most of you probably know, Kellogg produces and sells ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods like crackers, cereal and granola bars, waffles, noodles and so on. Essentially, it is a stock and a company that does well regardless of what situation the economy is in. People buy cereal during recession and during economic boom. Plus, the stock is inflation-proof because Kellogg can pass on increased costs to its customers. Kellogg's earnings are also expected to grow by 5% annually over the next 3 years which is decent for a stock of Kellogg's size. When it comes to the dividend, the company has a stable cashflow and can afford to pay out a consistent and stable dividend. We can see that in their payout ratio which is 61% for this year and expected to be 56% in next year. Most importantly, Kellogg has raised its dividend every year for the last 10 years and right now has a dividend yield of 3.7%. The industry average for food manufacturers is 2.6% and like I mentioned before, the average for the top 25% of dividend payers in the US is 3.5%. Kellogg pays a higher dividend than both, which is really good to see. Also, Kellogg's discounted cash flow is valued at $82.7 by Finbox and $120 by SimplyWallStreet so there is the bullish case for a higher price there. The stock currently trades at a PE of 17 and a forward PE of 15, both of which are under the average PE of 22.1 for the US Food industry. Overall, Kellogg seems like a good deal right now.\n\n# Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)\n\nThe third favourite dividend stock is the Walgreens Boots Alliance, another consumer staples stock. The company is a pharmacy-led\u00a0health and beauty retail company and operates over 9,000 stores in the US under the\u00a0Walgreens and Duane Reade brands. Similar to Kellogg, the Walgreens Boots Alliance does okay regardless of what situation the economy is in. The stock is inflation-proof and it is also a good way to get exposure to the retail and health industries. Again, just like Kellogg, Walgreens have a\u00a0steady cash flow which enables it to pay a sustainable dividend. Their dividend yield is 4.1%, higher than the average for consumer retailing industry which stands at 1.6% and also places Walgreens in the top dividend payers in the US overall. Like Verizon and Kellog, Walgreens has also raised their dividend every year for the last 10 years. Their payout ratio is 72% this year, but it's expected to drop down to 38% next year. That's because Walgreens experienced a drop in earnings during the lockdown, but their operating and free cash flow remained the same meaning that there are no problems with the business. That's also why they are expected to increase their earnings by 22% annually over the next three years. Right now, they trade at a good price. Their PE ratio is 17.9 compared to the industry average of 16.7, but their forward PE is 9.2 which is really good. They are valued at $69 by Finbox and $120 by SimplyWallStreet so again there is a bullish case for a jump in price. Overall, Walgreens is a low-risk high-paying dividend stock.\n\n# STAG Industrial (STAG) and Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nMy final two dividend stocks today are STAG Industrial and the Medical Properties Trust. Both of these are real estate investment trusts, abbreviated as REITs. STAG Industrial focuses on acquiring and operating single-tenant industrial properties whereas the Medical Properties Trust acquires and develops net-leased hospital facilities. I like these two for several reasons. First, they've got an excellent dividend. STAG has a dividend of 3.6% whereas the Medical Properties Trust has a solid 5.3% dividend yield! The average dividend for REITs is about 2.9% so both of these offer really good dividends! Again, similar to the other three companies before, both STAG and the Medical Properties Trust have raised their dividend numerous times. Plus, they have ***never ever*** suspended or lowered it. They do have a high payout ratio with 68% to 79% for STAG and 65% to 70% for the Medical Properties Trust, but a high payout ratio is typical for REITs. Paying dividends is really what a REIT is meant to do so that's not surprising. Plus, both STAG and the Medical Properties Trust have a high level of occupancy which means that we can expect sustainable earnings and therefore sustainable dividends from them. However, there is another reason why I like these two. Inflation is on everybody's mind right now and buying real estate is the ***perfect hedge against inflation***\u00a0because\u00a0real estate tends to go up in price during inflationary periods. REITs allow you to buy real estate without having to dish out money for a mortgage and tying yourself down for 20 years! It allows you to benefit from rising real estate prices and that is an important benefit of owning REITs. With STAG and the Medical Properties Trust you will not only be getting an amazing dividend stock, you will also be protecting your portfolio from inflation. Two birds with one stone.\n\nWhat are your favourite dividend stocks?",

I have some other stocks that are down so much I'm just gonna hold for years to come, but with news of a recession I'm thinking of selling my KO (up 18% from when I bought it) and my GOOG (down .28%) Is this a good idea? Or will the rumored crash likely just effect more international stocks who get supply from China such as NVDA? Thanks in advance.",

They were down 3 percent????? Why?!\n\nOh. That's because even though their snack business crushed it last quarter, most of those fast food and fast casual restaurants that serve their carbonated beverages were closed. Some went out of business. Others were closed for a stay at home order. Movie theaters were empty and theme parks were...well not many people going to theme parks either, huh?\n\nBut wait. Weren't other places open?\n\nYes they were. But the people who bought at those places didn't get free refills and just left after picking up their food to go. Many didn't need a drink at all because what's the point if you are just taking it home. (And who wants some random GrubHub driver drinking some of your Cherry Pepsi before you get it.)\n\nSo what does that mean for Coke? Not sure. Maybe they pull a rabbit out of their hat and have only a 5% revenue decline this quarter. Maybe thier sales will be flat vs the prior quarter.  Can it happen? Sure. But I doubt it.\n\nPepsi's decline was 7% last quarter, but Coke has more penetration in restaurants than Pepsi. So I would guess that Coke's decline is double digits in carbonated beverages segment. And that could be bad for the stock.\n\nAnywhow. For those in the stock, this is your opportunity to revisit your assumptions and potentially sell. For those out of the stock, here's easy prey to hedge against a market decline.\n\nUntil next time, this is Lavender wishing you good luck in a crazy market full of volatility.\n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/pepsico-pep-earnings-q2-2020.html",

Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.\n\nThe last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings.\n\nSomething nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause.\n\nPersonally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies. \n\nBeyond that I'm looking into different oil / ng etfs because I don't have any exposure there. \n\nJust curious where other people stand with the run up on some of these more popular large caps and where you're currently looking to get exposure",

Literally every shared portfolio, due diligence and stock opinion is finshed with the I invest for the long term, so I do not really care about the price fluctuations. \n\nYet the sheer panic and mood changes on stocks are made after every small dip, missed earnings or change in analyst estimates. \n\nThe thing is, that the value of company and mass concensus here is not made by anything, but simple price change. \n\nThe company\u2019s stock rose singnificantly in the last year?\n\nIt is a complete beast and literally everyone needs it in their portfolio!\n\nThey missed earnings by 50 basis points, there is small change in the estimates for next year and the stock had not changed in a 6 months?\n\nImmediately sell the company, because you are lacking after the last year biggest homeruns!\n\nThe reason why this thing is happening is, because most people do not know or have the slightest idea about how much they value their business! \n\nIf you would have a strong opinion on how much you value your business, you want sell it after you believed that you have paid 50 cents on a dollar for it. Most of you are valueing business on the market price that is quoted last second. \n\nThe other thing is that you do not understand the businesses you own!\n\nNo, saying Iunderstand Coca-Cola because i know it sells Coke is not understanding business. How many of you know the balance sheet of KO, how many of you read the 10Q and 10K, do you know that KO\u2019s payout ratio of their dividends is above 80% and often was 100% plus? Do you know the management? Can you give a pricetag on these cash flows, that KO will make? \n\nAnd this is talking about KO, which is relatively easy to understand company, that nearly everyone has some experience with. I really do not believe that even 0,1% of people who read palantirs reports, looked at its valuation, and most importantly understand the business of the company.\n\nAnswer honestly to yourself.\n\nDo you really know the business you own?\n\nLastly i would want to say a story about mass opinions on companies. Microsoft and Apple were for many years considered mature companies with limited growth. Apple was even considered with negative growth rate. After last three years rally in their prices, the opinion on them changed so much that literally everyone believes that they must have them in their portfolio. \n\nWould you also consider this if the price of the stock did not change?",

Coke\u2019s organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 12% in the quarter.\n\nCoke reported unit case volume growth of 2% for the quarter. The metric excludes pricing and foreign currency.\n\nHowever, North American volume shrank 1%, as demand for Coke\u2019s water, sports drinks, coffee and tea fell. For comparison, rival PepsiCo saw volume for its North American beverage unit fall 6% in the fourth quarter. Pepsi executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings squeezed consumers\u2019 budgets, leading shoppers to seek out private label options or smaller pack sizes.\n\nFor 2024, Coke is forecasting organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and an increase in comparable earnings per share of 4% to 5%. The company expects that foreign exchange rates will weigh on both its earnings and revenue for the full year.\n\nLooking to the first quarter, Coke is anticipating a 4% headwind from currency exchange rates on its comparable revenue. The company also expects foreign exchange to slow its earnings per share growth, and anticipates an 8% hit from currency changes during the period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/coca-cola-ko-q4-2023-earnings.html",

Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. \rA famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.\r  \n\r\r  \nSo, which company is the better investment choice?\r We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?\r  \n\r  \nHistorically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.\r\n\n# Latest Earnings \n\nAt the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. \rMeanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. \r\n\n# Valuation Metrics\n\nPepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6. \n\n# Margins\n\nThe small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.\r \n\n# Capital Structure\n\nThe capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \\~$250B and debts of \\~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B). \r  \n\r  \nHowever, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.\n\nSince that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.\r\n\n# Dividends \n\nCoke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.\r  \n\r  \nThat's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list.\r Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%. \r  \n\r  \nAt this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.\r\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nNow, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.\n\n# Price Targets\n\nMy personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. \rThe [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.\r\n\nOn the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. \r[Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nNow, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. \n\nThat's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?\r  \n\r  \n**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**",

Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\n\n\u201cWe expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,\u201d analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\n\nTesla\u2019s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a \u201cpotentially unsustainable driver\u201d of earnings and cash flow.\n\nAutomakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can\u2019t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.\n\nTesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company\u2019s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called \u201cActually Smart Summon.\u201d\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that his \u201cbest guess\u201d is that \u201cvehicle growth\u201d will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing \u201clower cost vehicles\u201d and the \u201cadvent of autonomy.\u201d Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\n\nEven bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk\u2019s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, \u201cOur view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),\u201d and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk\u2019s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a \u201cmaybe.\u201d They set their estimate at 14%.\n\nIt \u201cclearly depends on the company\u2019s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.\n\nA grain of salt\n\nMusk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nBernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: \u201cThe tone of Tesla\u2019s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.\u201d\n\nMusk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. \n\nThe Bernstein analysts wrote, \u201cWe continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.\u201d\n\nThey pointed to Musk\u2019s \u201clong history of being overly optimistic about FSD\u201d and said crowdsourced research that shows \u201cTesla continues to lag well behind competitors\u201d on robotaxis.\n\nThe share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla\u2019s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/tesla-shares-surge-as-analysts-react-to-q3-earnings-musk-predictions.html",

However, where PEP net income only grew 41%, KO's grew 107%. What is -generally speaking- the meaning of this? Does it mean that KO is running a much more efficient operation?\n* Marketcap of both companies grew basically the same: up \\~140% over the last 17 years.

(PEP)**\n\nPepsiCo is a multinational food, snack and beverage corporation responsible for some of the most popular brand names in the world. Their umbrella of products includes Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Gatorade, Quaker Foods, Cheetos, Lays, Doritos, Aquafina, and many more. Compared to their main competitor, Coca-Cola, they offer a far more diverse catalog of products thanks to their expansion into the food and snack industries. \n\nIf we compare 5 year stock growth, PEP is up 35% over that span while Coca-Cola (KO) is up only 16%. Looking at annual sales growth over the past 5 years, PEP is up 0.1% while KO is actually down 4.1%. Additionally, PEP's 5 year dividend growth rate is 8.41% while KO's is 5.57%. While these numbers are relatively close over a small time span, I think the long term edge goes to PepsiCo unless Coca-Cola can expand their product offerings.\n\n**PEP Financials Breakdown** \n\n- Frito-Lay North America - $16.8B = 25% of revenue\n- Quaker Foods North America - $2.7B = 4% of revenue\n- PepsiCo Beverages North America - $21.5B = 32% of revenue\n- Latin America - $7.4B = 11% of revenue\n- Europe - $12.1B = 18% of revenue\n- Other - $6.7B = 10% of revenue\n\nFood accounted for 54% of revenue, beverages accounted for 46%\n\nUS Sales accounted for 58% of revenue, international sales accounted for 42%\n\nNet Sales: $67.2B in 2019, (+3.9% vs 2018)\n\nOperating Profit: $10.6B in 2019, (No change vs 2018) \n\nAssets/Liabilities: $5.5B in cash & cash equivalents; $29.1B in long term debt with $18.9B not due until after 2024\n\n[Data from 2019 Annual Report](https://www.pepsico.com/docs/album/annual-reports/pepsico-inc-2019-annual-report.pdf?sfvrsn=ea470b5_2)\n\n**Other Information**\n\nPepsiCo is a dividend aristocrat (25+ years of increasing dividends) with a current streak of 48 years, meaning they are only 2 years away from reaching dividend king status. The stock's current yield is 3.08%. [A good resource on Dividend Aristocrats from one of my favorite sites can be found here](https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-aristocrats-list/)\n\nPepsiCo has 22 individual brands that each generate at least $1B in annual revenue, 8 of which are food/snack brands. Coca-Cola is close behind with 20 $1B brands.\n\nPepsiCo recently acquired [Rockstar Energy Beverages](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814462332/pepsico-seeks-boost-in-energy-drink-market-with-purchase-of-rockstar) for $3.85B, expanding their product offerings as well as strengthening their presence in the energy drink market.\n\nAs of 2018, PepsiCo sourced 76% of its power via wind energy, with goals of transitioning 100% of US direct operations to renewable electricity. After past controversies over their environmental footprint, its good to see them working towards a more sustainable future.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nWhen it comes to the consumer sector stocks PepsiCo is one of my favorites, right up there next to Costco (COST) and Procter & Gamble (PG). PepsiCo's stock has been a slow and steady mover over the past decade (up about 109%), and with a worldwide market to sell their products I think they will continue to see increases in sales. Their growth combined with dividend payouts make them an attractive option for long-term investors, although they are probably better suited for more conservative strategies. Their push to market and develop healthier products will leave them well-positioned to capture additional market share, as well as protect them from any declines in sales of soft drinks and other sugary beverages.\n\nWhile I own both PEP and KO in my portfolio, I'm more bullish on PEP. I think KO's smaller collection of brands will limit their long term growth (unless they make some big moves in the next several years). Both companies have worked towards expanding into healthier beverages, but PEP's large catalog of snack and food products still offer a wider economic moat. My favorite fact about PEP (as mentioned above) is their 22 individual brands that each generate $1B+ in sales. We always talk about diversifying our portfolios, but it isn't often that a company can be as equally diverse in terms of its revenue streams.",

        "post_text": "Apple today is a good example why the markets are so hard. Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, \"Why did the markets go up/down today?\"\n\nAnd there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, \"Because there were more buyers than sellers\" (or vice versa).\n\nApple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.\n\nHowever, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.\n\nSome folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.\n\nWith all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and \"fly\" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.\n\nFull disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.\n\nThere is currently a bubble in \"safe\" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a \"flight to safety\" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.\n\nI think the moves in these \"value\" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. \"You won't be fired for buying IBM\". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP? You'll still have your job.",

Hey guys with the new year around I was thinking what you guys are looking into buying and holding starting Jan 2024. \n\nHere are two screening rules. \n- must be listed in US (nasdaq or nyse)\n- must be an index stock with a market cap above 20B\n\nMajor factors for me are\n- interest rate cuts \n- gen ai \n- value vs market. \n\nMy top 5 picks for the new year:\n- Amazon. Overall a great company, but with the whole AI race and AWS providing it as a service, I think there will be some good tail winds for this stock in the new year. \n\nGoogle: the latest AI show and tell from Google was mind blowing. They have a chatgpt killer. I think Google is back as the leader in ai based search.\n\nPalo Alto Networks: cyber security is still going to be big in the next year and Palo Alto is comparative priced better when compared to Crowdstrike and others and they have products that align better for SMBs. So I feel they would have a good upside in comparison to competition. \n\nAdobe:  I think this is another gen ai play. I feel with the whole digital media space has been really disrupted with gen ai. I would have loved to see the whole Figma purchase go through but nonetheless I think there is a lot going on here and I will see a lot of general users coming onboard adobe  now as the learning curve has just got flatter. \n\nPayPal: this stock has done soo bad and fallen soo much that it\u2019s just dead cheap in comparison to the sp500. With new leadership I feel things are going to see some improvement in the coming year. Fingers crossed. \n\nTell me what you guys are looking at and your reasons. :)",

        "post_text": "PepsiCo beats Wall Street estimates, raises earnings outlook $PEP PepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts\u2019 expectations and raised its outlook for its full-year earnings.  \n\n\nShares of the company rose 2% in premarket trading.  \n\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  \n\n\n\\- Earnings per share: $2.25 adjusted vs. $2.15 expected  \n\\- Revenue: $23.45 billion vs. $23.39 billion expected\n\nFor 2023, Pepsi now expects constant currency earnings per share growth of 13%, up from its prior forecast of 12%. It\u2019s the third consecutive quarter that the snacking and beverage giant has hiked its full-year forecast.  \n\n\nPepsi reported third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.09 billion, or $2.24 per share, up from $2.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier.  \n\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $2.25 per share.  \n\n\nNet sales rose 6.7% to $23.45 billion. The company\u2019s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 8.8% in the quarter.  \n\n\nBut PepsiCo\u2019s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, fell again this quarter. Pepsi\u2019s price hikes to mitigate inflation have weakened demand for its products. The company has also been shrinking portions and making smaller value packs to drive more transactions, Pepsi executives told analysts on a conference call. That strategy results in more affordable options for consumers \u2014 and lower volume sold.  \n\n\nPepsi\u2019s North American beverages unit reported volume declines of 6%. CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has pruned some promotions, such as for its bottled water business, in order to preserve margins. But those deals drove volume for the drinks, gains that disappeared without the promotions.  \n\n\nThere were some bright spots in beverages. Gatorade, for example, saw double-digit revenue growth. The company also plans to relaunch Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a fan favorite flavor that is available only at Taco Bell.  \n\n\nThe company\u2019s North American food divisions performed better than the beverages unit did. Quaker Foods North America\u2019s volume rose 1%, while Frito-Lay North America\u2019s volume was flat. Quaker Foods\u2019 brands also gained market share in key categories, such as pancake mix and syrup, executives said in prepared remarks.  \n\n\nLooking to 2024, Pepsi anticipates organic revenue growth on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.",

The drug has also decreased some patients' cravings to eat foods with high sugar or fat content, though, CNBC reported, which could cause problems for some food brands that have decided in recent years to lean into snacking while marketing their food. Food chains and companies producing junk food were predicted to be potential losers of the weight loss drug boom because of the decreased appetite for unhealthy foods, Markets Insider reported last week.",

        "post_text": "AT&T (NYSE: T) - An excellent opportunity for Dividend Investors, or those looking to start.  \n\nAT&T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.\n\n**Why this is being posted now & the potential:**\n\n* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.\n* At its current price AT&T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.\n\n**What AT&T has going for it:**\n\n* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.\n* Consistent revenue growth.\n* Lots and lots of cash on hand.\n* They are a leader in the US for 5G.\n* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).\n* Warner Media and HBO Max\n\nWarner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.\n\nThe safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.\n\n**Two big issues:**\n\n* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow too much)\n* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)\n\nIt could be a good sign that AT&T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.\n\n**Final Comments:**\n\nPlease extend this by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all that posted constructive comments! As several have pointed out, yes, AT&T has underperformed the S&P, it should be avoided if you aren't seeking out a high paying dividend stock.",

Could it just be general market bullishness?\n\nI can't really explain it away.\n\nThen earnings came out which sounded pretty positive to me, revenue looks good, restructuring makes sense, raising dividend. Fairly good all around except for the declining in sugary soda sales. Ok, seems like that's a long term trend nothing to really get spooked about.

        "post_text": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

This lead me to the following 11 companies:\n**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**\n\nI have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "post_text": "PepsiCo earnings beat estimates as international demand boosts sales  PepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts\u2019 expectations, despite a recall of some Quaker Foods cereal and bars that dented U.S. volume.\n\nShares of the company were down less than 1% in premarket trading.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.61 adjusted vs. $1.52 expected\n\nRevenue: $18.25 billion vs. $18.07 billion expected\n\nPepsi reported first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.04 billion, or $1.48 per share, up from $1.93 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, Pepsi earned $1.61 per share.\n\nNet sales rose 2.3% to $18.25 billion. The company\u2019s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2.7% in the quarter.\n\nBut the company\u2019s volume is still under pressure. Pepsi, along with many of its rivals, has seen its volume fall in response to higher prices for its Gatorade, Fritos and other products in its portfolio.\n\nThe company\u2019s food division saw its volume decrease 0.5%, while its beverage segment reported flat volume. The metric strips out pricing and currency changes to reflect demand.\n\nA recall of many Quaker Foods cereals and bars only worsened Pepsi\u2019s volume problem. The company issued the first recall for potential salmonella contamination in December, then widened it in January. The North American Quaker Food division reported that its volume cratered 22% in the quarter. The Quaker Foods recall dented Pepsi\u2019s organic volume by roughly 1%.\n\nPepsi will officially close a Quaker Oats plant tied to the recalls in June, although production there has already ceased. Pepsi said that the company has resumed limited production of certain products affected by the recalls.\n\nPepsi\u2019s other North American divisions also reported weaker volume. Volume in its beverage unit fell 5% in the quarter, while Frito-Lay North America reported a 2% decline in its volume.\n\nOutside of the U.S., demand was stronger. Its Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China region reported 12% volume growth for snacks. Even in Europe, which has also struggled with higher grocery prices, beverage volume increased 7% and snack volume rose 2%.\n\nPepsi also reiterated its 2024 outlook. For the full year, the company is expecting organic revenue will rise at least 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will climb at least 8%.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead, we continue to expect a normalization and moderation in category growth rates versus the last few years,\u201d Pepsi executives said in prepared remarks. \u201cWe also continue to expect that consumers will remain watchful with their budgets and choiceful with their purchases.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/pepsico-pep-q1-2024-earnings.html",

        "post_text": "PepsiCo earnings top estimates, but quarterly revenue slides for the first time in nearly four years PepsiCo\n on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as North American demand for its food and drinks weakened.\n\nCEO Ramon Laguarta said that U.S. sales broadly slowed down in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cPart of that is a slowdown due to pricing and [consumers\u2019] disposable income situation,\u201d he told investors on the company\u2019s conference call.\n\nHe added that U.S. consumers are also shifting their behavior from eating and drinking at home to picking up more of their snacks and Gatorade from convenience stores. But Laguarta expressed optimism about the overall state of the consumer, citing low unemployment and hopes that interest rates will fall by the summer and wages will rise faster than inflation.\n\nShares of the company fell 3% in morning trading.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.78 adjusted vs. $1.72 expected\n\nRevenue: $27.85 billion vs. $28.4 billion expected\n\n\nPepsi reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.3 billion, or 94 cents per share, up from $518 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the food and beverage giant earned $1.78 per share.\n\nNet sales dropped less than 1% to $27.85 billion. It\u2019s the first quarter since 2020 that the company\u2019s quarterly revenue has declined compared with the year-ago period. Currency exchange rates dragged net sales down by 1.5%.\n\nPepsi\u2019s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, rose 4.5% in the quarter, helped by higher prices. But those same raised prices have hurt demand for the company\u2019s food and drinks. Pepsi\u2019s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, slid again this quarter.\n\nPepsiCo executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings have squeezed consumers\u2019 budgets, particularly in North America, in prepared remarks released ahead of the company\u2019s conference call. They also said consumers are increasingly choosing smaller pack sizes for convenience and their low price points.\n\nPepsi\u2019s North American Quaker Foods division reported an 8% decline in volume. A voluntary recall of its granola bars and cereals hurt its sales during the quarter, along with weaker growth for the overall category.\n\nFrito-Lay North America, which includes brands like Cheetos and Doritos, posted a 2% drop in volume.\n\nPepsi\u2019s North American beverage unit saw its volume fall 6% in the quarter.\n\nFor 2024, Pepsi now anticipates organic revenue will rise at least 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will climb at least 8%. The company previously forecast an increase in organic revenue on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.\n\n\u201cConsumers are likely to remain watchful with their budgets and choiceful with their purchases,\u201d Pepsi executives said in the prepared remarks.\n\nPepsi is predicting a weaker first half of the year as product recalls dent its North American Quaker Oats business and international conflicts hurt sales in some regions. Executives are expecting international organic revenue growth to top that of North America for the full year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/pepsico-pep-q4-2023-earnings.html",

        "post_text": "Pepsi - on my radar The stock of PepsiCo is up year to date, exceeding Coca-Cola, but behind the S&P 500. With a solid business strategy, PepsiCo continually grows sales and profits while responding to shifting consumer behaviour. They are ideally situated to expand in the years to come. Future growth is fueled by the omnichannel strategy, which also incorporates e-commerce and away-from-home activities, the previously mentioned brand adaptability, and the pep+ plan. For instance, 53% of beverages are sugar-reduced. Targets for reducing salt have been met by 66% of convenient foods. This is consistent with customer \"zeitgeist\" and might encourage brand loyalty.\r  \nUnfortunately, the stock price has already factored in a significant portion of the expected earnings. As a result, the adjusted PE ratio would still be higher than 20 based on an adjusted EPS of $8.74 in 2025. But PepsiCo stock has never been inexpensive, so investors hoping for significant price drops are probably better off staying away from the market for good. Only the extreme Corona crisis crash in the previous five years experienced a greater share price loss than the current one. Pepsi's adjusted P/E ratio for the past 15 years has hovered around 20.5, which is high for a company with a very cautious growth strategy. The valuation is considerably more pricey right now, at 25. The P/C ratio and the current dividend yield both fit this description.\r  \nAlthough Pepsi is a superb firm with fantastic global brands, its price is still high. Pepsi is on my radar as an investment if there is any additional weakness, even though it is still pricey.\r  \n",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&P 500 companies.\n*****\n> It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n> Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n> Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n> On Friday, the S&P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n> Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n> \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n> Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n> # Fed bazooka\n> The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n> \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n> Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n> Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n> \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n> # Economic impact\n> First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n> Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n> The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n> So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n> # Earnings\n> Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n> An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n> \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n> He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n> May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n> In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n> One month ago today the S&P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n> \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n> The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n> \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n> The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n> The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n> As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n> Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n> We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n> As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n> Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n> Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n> The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n> In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n> With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n> Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 dipped 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.5%.\n*****\n> Stocks surged during Thursday\u2019s regular session, with the S&P 500 rising 1.7% to close over the 5,700 level for the first time. The blue-chip Dow ended the day more than 500 points higher to post its first-ever close above 42,000. Both indexes also registered all-time highs during the day. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.5%.\n*****\n> Unemployment data, along with the Fed\u2019s half-point rate cut on Wednesday, seemed to bolster investors\u2019 sentiment.

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 13, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, which generated $80 million* in theater sales and $60 million* in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday\u2019s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to last year\u2019s attack\u201d and that the company was still \u201cunaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers\u201d. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

Feel free to rip me, or drop an \"atta boy\" -- That's why we're all here!\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now >70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by >8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.\n\nDo your thing Reddit, Have a spectacular week, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!",

        "post_text": "Coca-Cola as a recovery play?  As everyone is well aware, the market has been a wild ride for the past couple weeks, with tech being crushed while \"re-opening\" and other value plays like energy have mostly performed well. We've seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those.\n\nKO is trading at just under $51 as of today's close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.\n\nWith that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings.\n\nTheir CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:\n\n[https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT\\_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208\\_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&Expires=1615332187&Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D](https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&Expires=1615332187&Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D)\n\nEven with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called \"reopening plays,\" I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I'm not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I'm just surprised that more people don't seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There's a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.\n\nWith that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (\\~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I've been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.\n\nI decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I'm not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I'm obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I'd hate to miss out on those gains.\n\nIs KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I have no shares of KO at the present time.",

Over the years my portfolio has grown overall, but recently I\u2019ve been educating myself on stocks/investing and I think there is definitely lots of room for improvement.\n\nI am now 32 and I\u2019m in the process of setting up my own portfolio made up of index funds in a Fidelity brokerage account, Roth IRA, and 401k (I did not include these accounts in the Imgur album but it\u2019s a mix of FZROX/VTSAX/VOO in my retirement accounts + VTI/VXUS/AVUV/AVDV in my taxable account). However I\u2019d still like to maintain a stock portfolio in my Schwab account to play around with. With about $500k in assets, I\u2019m thinking of allocating approximately $400k (80%) to index funds and $100k (20%) to individual stocks. I have $20k in I-bonds as well but I\u2019m still undecided on whether to include more bonds as part of my portfolio at this time. I\u2019d rather focus on growth/accumulation at this time and potentially set myself up for early retirement. \n\nWith all that in mind, which equities do you think I should keep and which should I sell? For starters, I think I\u2019d like to sell all the mutual funds that my grandparents chose and instead put it into VTI/VXUS/AVUV/AVDV which have better historical and expected returns (keeping a 20% SCV tilt with AVUV/AVDV). As far as individual stocks, there are several blue chip stocks that have done really well like PG, DIS, CAT, POST, and PEP, but I\u2019m wondering if I should sell high along with some that have stagnated like XOM, INTC, BA, C, and GE to name a few. \n\nBasically I\u2019d like to totally revamp my portfolio and invest in stocks that I believe in rather than what was chosen for me years ago. Also since my index fund allocation already gives me plenty of exposure to U.S. large cap, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worthwhile to invest additional funds in FAANG + MSFT or should I focus on high risk/high reward value stocks instead with the \u201cplay money\u201d I have. Any advice and input is much appreciated!\n\nEdit: [Here is a list of stocks I have on my watchlist](https://imgur.com/a/ZGcAQmv/) that I\u2019d like to potentially invest in after selling some of the equities I\u2019m currently holding. \n\nAside from the mega cap companies, there\u2019s a lot of tech/financial services along with healthcare companies. I work in healthcare so I feel I have more insight into that industry.",

My point is that i just want to invest in quality businesses that proofed their position for a long time and have less volatility than the Market. My problem is that in Germany you can\u2018t just set a DRIP programme for Dividends and you have to reinvest that manually and that means a lot of work for me. What strategy should i follow and why?",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 10, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 10, 2021**\n\nChoppiness in the market continued, with stocks closing the day mixed, with the tech- heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) powered to new, intraday record highs, driven by strength in financial and industrial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, traded mostly even, closing the day 0.22% higher. Like I have been saying for weeks now, while I remain bullish I expect a lot of choppiness in the market moving forward. In my view, there are a variety of contending factors affecting the market, including but not limited to: (1) record corporate earnings, (2) Senate\u2019s passage of the infrastructure bill, (3) improving labor market, (4) rising concerns surrounding the delta variant, (5) concerns around inflation, (6) regulatory concerns in China.\n\nToday, the price of oil rebounded from a three week low, with the market hoping that the resilient demand from the West may offset weak demand from China. Yesterday, oil prices tumbled due to concerns that the latest outbreak of COVID in China would trigger a swift response from the government, which has been so far extremely aggressive in battling the virus. China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 146 new infections as of Monday - the fourth straight day it reported 90 cases and above and the second day it has reported over 100 cases. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. \n\nWhile those numbers are very small compared to the US, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called \u201czero-COVID\u201d approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is possible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, the CCP has ordered mass testing in areas of high transmission, re-implemented extensive lockdowns, enacted new travel restrictions within the country, and extended the closure of its borders to foreign travelers. As of yesterday, at least 47 officials have been punished for \u201cnegligence\u201d, according to state reports. \n\nShockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The 2020 Olympics concluded and were a wild disappointment, with ratings experiencing a 42% decline compared to the 2016 Olympics. \n* Wild ride in AMC today. Shares gapped up more than 10% premarket before falling throughout the session to close the day -6% down, a 16% intraday swing. \n* According to a new report by the Department of Labor, worker productivity grew at a slower-than-expected pace in Q2. Nonfarm productivity grew at a 2.3% annualized rate, down from 4.3% pace in Q1\n* Pepsi (PEP) partnered with Boston Beer (SAM) to produce an alcoholic rendition of the popular soda Mountain Dew. Product expected to be on the shelves by early 2022\n* DraftKings (DKNG) announced a content partnership with Autograph, an NFT company founded by NFL superstar Tom Brady. Matt Kalish, DKNG President said, \u201cAutograph\u2019s Advisory Board includes some of the most iconic athletes ever and we could not imagine a more fitting figure than Tom Brady to headline our first ever NFT drop on DraftKings Marketplace.\u201d A lot of activity has been coming from DKNG recently. \n* Tesla sold 32,968 China-made cars, including those for export, according tyo the China Passenger Car Association. \n* Upstart (UPST), one of my fav fin-tech stocks that I\u2019ve been holding for a while popped off after earnings, up more than 15%. I\u2019m very happy about that :)\n* Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he is \u201ctrying to build the most forward-thinking sports gambling company\u201d. This comes on the backs of Penn\u2019s (who owns 36% of Barstool) acquired Score Media, the leading sports content app in Canada and third largest in the US. I think this is a very interesting partnership between all companies.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $205 to $210 at Overweight. Stock currently around $170\n* Invitation Homes (INVH) target raised by Raymond James from $41 to $46 at Strong-Buy. Stock currently around $39\n* Cloudflare (NET) target raised by Argus from $125 to $140 at Buy.

Long term holds that I don't plan on looking at or touching too often.  The question I have is - what is the reason do to do this rather than just put it all in some index fund like VTI?  Am I better off just throwing all of these funds in an index fund like that? Realistically the chances of these stocks beating the overall market seem to be slim. Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question!\n\n  \nFor transperancy, I was planning on putting \\~70% of my funds into index funds (VTI and SCHD) anyway, and using the other 30% for specific stocks.  Is it better to just put 100% into ETFs?",

I have been doing my a little research on my own and have come to the conclusion that I want to invest in $PEP (Pepsi). Is this a good choice?

I know it isn\u2019t much and that I won\u2019t gain much money on it, but this is going to be my first investment so I\u2019m thinking about not putting in alot, just a little bit. To learn the ropes. So is $PEP a good first stock or am I being dumb? If it\u2019s a bad stock, what should I buy instead?

        "post_text": "PepsiCo Raises Dividend, Marches Toward Dividend King Status PepsiCo is raising its dividend once again \nPepsiCo will be increasing its quarterly dividend per share to $1.075, payable on March 31, 2022, for shareholders as of March 4, 2022. That will be a 5% increase from the dividend in the same period a year ago and consistent with PepsiCo's announcement that it will increase its annual dividend to $4.30 from $4.09. Since the pandemic's onset, the company has thrived as billions of folks spend more time at home where they have more opportunities to reach for snacks and beverages.\n\nThe dividend increase is part of a long trend. Between 2011 and 2020, PepsiCo investors saw their dividends per share nearly double from from $2.03 to $4.02. Those gains came despite PepsiCo's difficulty in growing earnings, which expanded at a compound rate of just 2.7% in that same time. As a result, PepsiCo's dividend payout ratio increased over the years to reach 70.5% most recently. While on the high side, it is still manageable.\n\nA dividend payout ratio above 100% is unsustainable as that means a company is paying more in dividends than it is earning in net profits. In that case, the excess over 100% is coming from either savings or borrowing, which are unsustainable sources in the long run. That said, existing shareholders should expect only a modest dividend increase in the near term from PepsiCo until or if it can unlock more robust earnings growth.\n\nStill, PepsiCo's stock pays a healthy dividend yield of 2.46%. Combined with gains in the stock price, it has delivered respectable shareholder returns. Interestingly, after struggling to grow revenue for the first half of the decade, PepsiCo accelerated growth in the past four years. In 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, PepsiCo increased revenue by 1.2%, 1.8%, 3.9%, and 4.8%, respectively. If it can sustain the momentum for the next several years, it could give earnings a boost and further fuel increases in dividends to shareholders. \n\nWhat this could mean for PepsiCo stock \nReaching the 50-year milestone may give PepsiCo stock a home among income-seeking investors who prefer Dividend Kings. The status is proof that the company can sustain and grow dividend payments through good times and bad as a company will have encountered a myriad of challenges over that period. The most discerning dividend investors can place PepsiCo on their list of income stocks to consider.",

        "post_text": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Oct 6, 2021. Please enjoy!  \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 6, 2021**\n\nStocks opened the session lower, with the S&P 500 (SPY) falling as much as 1.2% early before turning positive in yet another volatile session after a report that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would approve an extension of the government debt ceiling until at least December. Market participants collectively gave a massive sigh of relief now that we aren\u2019t staring down the barrel of a default. You can never count on Congress in the US, but I did say I thought it was very unlikely that the Senate was going to let the American economy implode by choice. In my humble opinion, I think the worse is behind us and look forward to buying up the first -5% and -8%  dip in the SPY and Nasdaq (QQQ) all year, though I do expect some choppiness moving forward. \n\nIn recent weeks, market participants have been anxiously monitoring developments out of Washington DC, as Congressional lawmakers debated raising the debt ceiling and avoiding an absolute catastrophe if the US were to default on its debt, something that has never (and hopefully will never) happen. Put bluntly, a debt default would plunge the economy into a long-lasting recession, GDP growth would slide and millions would lose their jobs. According to a report by Moody\u2019s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. \u201cInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say, \u201cGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government\u2019s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.\u201d\n\nMoreover, despite valid concerns surrounding inflation, recent economic data has been very upbeat recently, a sign that despite there being many obstacles remaining, the US economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. Durable goods, retail sales, and purchasing managers index-tracking activity across US manufacturing have all recently topped expectations. However, prices for those goods remain elevated compared to earlier periods due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions, shortages in key materials, and recently, rolling blackouts in China that have forced the closure of crucial factories ahead of the busiest shopping season of the year. \n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-energy-crunch-triggers-alarm-pleas-more-coal-2021-09-28/](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-energy-crunch-triggers-alarm-pleas-more-coal-2021-09-28/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Alphabet Inc's (GOOG) Google said it cut fuel use and traffic delays by 10% to 20% at four locations in Israel by using artificial intelligence to optimize signal lights and plans to test the software in Rio de Janeiro, the company said on Wednesday.\n* Tesla (TSLA) will have to pay $130 in punitive damages and $7 million to the victim after a jury found the automaker guilty of failing to take appropriate steps to prevent race-based harassment of factory workers. Punitive damages are designed to punish and to deter future unlawful conduct, while compensatory damages are intended to pay victims for their actual losses.\n* General Motors (GM) set a very ambitious financial target, telling investors it plans to more than double revenue by 203 with an influx of electric-models.\n* Facebook Inc has slowed down the rollout of new products in recent days, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, as the company faces a barrage of criticism from all directions. \n* Twitch.tv, the livestreaming platform owned by Amazon (AMZN), suffered a massive data breach that leaked the entire source code, user payout information, and the amount of money made by content creators. Twitch acknowledged the validity of the breach via Twitter (TWTR) [https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512)\n* Palantir (PLTR) secured a $823 million contract from the Army to employ use of its software. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Fundamental Research from $144 to $164 at Buy.

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 10th, 2022 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 10th, 2022.\n\n# **Dow drops 600 points, Nasdaq closes 3% lower as rates pop after September jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks fell Friday as traders evaluated September\u2019s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate continuing to decline and sparked an increase in interest rates.\n *****\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 630.15 points, or 2.1%, to 29,296.79. The S&P 500 lost 2.8% to 3,639.66. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.8% to 10,652.41, which is less than 1% above its low of the year.\n*****\n> Friday\u2019s losses trimmed the gains for what started out as a big comeback week for stocks. The major averages still ended the week higher but gave back most of the gains from the rally that kicked it off. The Dow rose 2% for the week, while the S&P added 1.5%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.7% gain.\n*****\n> The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, slightly below a Dow Jones estimate of 275,000, the government said Friday. However, the unemployment rate came in at 3.5%, down from the 3.7% in the previous month in a sign that the jobs picture continues to strengthen even as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy with rate hikes to stem inflation.\n*****\n> 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the S&P 500 this week\n*****\n> \u201cWhile the data was about as expected, the drop in the unemployment rate is seemingly what the markets are obsessed with because of what it means for the Fed,\u201d said Bleakley Financial chief investment officer Peter Boockvar. \u201cWhen combined with the low level of initial jobless claims, the pace of firing\u2019s remains muted and this of course gets the Fed all fired up about continuing with its aggressive rate hikes.\u201d\n*****\n> The falling unemployment rate sparked a jump in rates, in turn weighing on stocks. The 2-year year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 4.316%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.)\n*****\n> Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock tumbled after the chipmaker warned its third-quarter revenue would be lower than anticipated. Levi Strauss shares slipped following a cut to the company\u2019s guidance.\n*****\n> \u201cThe conclusion many we have spoken with have reached is that not only will the Fed not help markets, but in their dogged pursuit of price stability keep going until something breaks in the capital markets,\u201d said Christopher Harvey, an equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. \u201cWhat appears to be their increasingly singular focus \u2014 price stability \u2014 will likely help catalyze the dislocation.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iNHDoUg.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/uegLRyK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/nHdBXST.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/dF4fCCC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i7t9ani.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3hHSJRl.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mpjg1NC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6LoBJVS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Z8IIj4n.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1CWBtE0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kNIR3p9.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/V1AzhMd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/CS8o6Wv.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/19gha7o.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 7 Things to Know About The Historically Strong Fourth Quarter\n\n> \u201cYou make most of your money in a bear market, you just don\u2019t realize it at the time.\u201d Shelby Cullom Davis\n\n> We all blinked, and it is now October, which could be good if you are hoping for higher stock prices. But, as this great quote by Shelby Cullom Davis explains, people\u2019s decisions in a bear market will significantly impact their investments down the road.\n\n> Are you going to sell now that stocks are firmly in a bear market? Many investors have done that over the years and missed out on massive rallies as stocks eventually returned to new highs. This year hasn\u2019t been fun at all for investors, but better times could be coming, and making a rash decision now could greatly impact your investments years from now.\n\n> To help with this, today we\u2019ll take a closer look at the fourth quarter and show why a potential year-end rally (and maybe more) could be likely.\n\n> First, the fourth quarter is historically the best quarter of the year, with the S&P 500 up 4.1% on average and nearly 80% of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image001-800x409.png))**\n\n> Second, this is a midterm year, and the good news is that market gains during these years are backloaded. In fact, October is the best month of a midterm year, followed by the second best month in November and the third best in December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image002-800x338.png))**\n\n> Third, here\u2019s a chart we\u2019ve shared a lot lately, but we\u2019ll do it again, as it is very powerful. Midterm years tend to see weak stock returns in the first three quarters (check for 2022), but the fourth quarter of a midterm is the second-best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. The best quarter and third best quarter are right around the corner early next year. As bad as things have been this year, the calendar is currently a major tailwind.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image003-800x302.png))**\n\n> Fourth, the fourth quarter has historically done even better when September is down big. Given this year saw one of the worst Septembers ever for stocks, this could be another clue a bounce back is possible. To quote Lloyd Christmas, \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a chance!\u201d\n\n> Fifth, this was the third worst start to a year ever for the S&P 500. Well, the good news is looking at the ten worst starts ever to a year saw the fourth quarter higher nine times. Only in 2008 was it red; fortunately, we don\u2019t think we are in that environment. Going out a year, the S&P 500 was up eight times and higher, a median of 25.5%.\n\n> Sixth, the S&P 500 bear market cracked down 25% last week. As bad as that feels to investors, the stock market doesn\u2019t care about what just happened and only cares about what is next. The good news is once a bear market is down 25%, the returns going out can be quite strong, with the S&P 500 up nearly 23% on average a year later. Additionally, many lows took place soon after this milestone was hit, so a major low could be near. Yes, the \u201973/\u201974 recession, tech bubble, and financial crisis all saw more weakness (and in some cases for a long time), but we don\u2019t see an economy nearly as weak as those times. Therefore, we think this time will play out like the others, and stronger returns could be quite likely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image016-800x501.png))**\n\n> Here\u2019s another way of showing the study above. As you can see, many times once the S&P 500 was down 25%, it was quite near a major low.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image010-800x383.png))**\n\n> Seventh and lastly, October is known as a bear market killer. Remember, this year was the worst start to a year since 1974 and 2002. Below we show how bear markets tend to bottom in October, and sure enough, both of those vicious bears ended in October. The \u201973/\u201974 bear ended on October 3, while the tech bubble bear market bottomed on October 9.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image017-800x582.png))**\n\n> Investors are worried, and we understand those feelings here at the Carson Investment Research team. Could stocks bottom and rally? We think there\u2019s an above-average chance. And a chance is all we need, as Lloyd Christmas would say.\n\n*****\n\n> # Bears Remain Above 50%\n\n> The past week's rebound in equity prices has bolstered sentiment a bit as the latest AAII survey showed an increase in bullishness. For the second week in a row, bullish sentiment rose week over week to come in at 23.9%. That is, of course, still below the reading of 26.1% only three weeks ago and even further depressed relative to the historical average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-1.png))**\n\n> The pickup in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears. After two consecutive weeks of readings above 60% (the first such occurrence in the history of the survey), bearish sentiment has turned lower falling to 54.8%. As with bullish sentiment, that marks some improvement, but much more progress would need to be made to bring bearish sentiment back in line with the historical average of 30.5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2.png))**\n\n> Although the streak of readings above 60% is over, more than half of the respondents remain bearish. As shown below, that has grown to be the longest streak of such readings since the depths of the COVID Crash. Prior to that, there have only been six other such streaks: four occurring between 2008 and 2009 and the others occurring in August and October of 1990.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2a.png))**\n\n> With both bullish and bearish sentiment improving, the bull-bear spread has risen up to -30.9 after hitting the lowest level since 2009 only two weeks ago.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3.png))**\n\n> Again, in spite of any improvement, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bears as it has for more than half a year. As shown below, the bull-bear spread has remained negative for 27 weeks in a row. That is the second-longest streak of negative readings on record but would need to continue for another two months to surpass the 2020 record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3a.png))**\n\n> Not all of the losses to bearish sentiment went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rebounded slightly rising from sub-20% (the lowest level since April 2020) to 21.3%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-4.png))**\n\n***** \n\n> # Buy Yom Kippur Lines Up with Almanac Aggregate Cycle\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a4832d6fdcc1b0db9f7b597a6f323e3e/afcc082fb2746654-d9/s500x750/2340a68254a2e98cffd0707ba74c56465ef11baa.jpg))**\n\n> The market may not be down during the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period which ends today on Yom Kippur 2022. But it sure was a wild ride. Most importantly it lines up perfectly with our Almanac Aggregate Cycle. Back in mid-August this Aggregate Cycle called the end of the summer rally and now it\u2019s pointing to a big move higher.\n\n> You can check the full stats Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover in our September 23 post, but here\u2019s a reminder of the awesome history of rallies from midterm year Yom Kippur to pre-election Passover. DJIA p 10 of 12, average gain 12.0%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/78ef4e049bb2c3dec5da28ffa05aec88/afcc082fb2746654-d7/s500x750/67bcf215db10c6ed1dcb8fcb9c2854064389cc9f.jpg))**\n\n> Welcome to the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle \u2013 the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/37ae44df65fe96daacf40b4949d4743c/afcc082fb2746654-c7/s500x750/7e478b26c47fae7411588672f41e1ae7167f5177.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Big Bounce in Claims...Or Is It?\n\n> Following a few months of downward trending initial jobless claims bringing the indicator back down around multi-decade lows, there has finally been a significant uptick. Whereas last week's reading was revised lower to an even more impressive 190K (the lowest since April), the latest print soared 29K to 219K. That is only the highest level since the end of August, but it also is back in the range of pre-pandemic readings while also marking the largest week over week increase in claims since the first week of June.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-1.png))**\n\n> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose as might have been expected for the current week of the year. As shown in the second chart below, as far as consistency of week-over-week increases go, the current week of the year is tied with the 2nd and 45th (approximately the weeks of January 8th and November 5th) for fourth as claims have risen 85.5% of the time since 1967. Additionally, before seasonal adjustment, it was not a particularly large increase as the 13.3K WoW rise was half of the average for the comparable week of the year. Even after that increase, unadjusted claims have only been lower during the year's comparable week twice: 1968 and 1969. In other words, a drift higher in claims is normal at this point of the year, and even with that move higher, claims remain nothing short of impressive.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-2.png))**\n\n> As for continuing claims which are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number, the latest week saw a modest increase of 15K to 1.361 million. That snapped a streak of four consecutive weeks of declines. Whereas seasonally adjusted initial claims have risen back into the pre-pandemic range, continuing claims have only experienced a modest move higher and are well below their own levels from pre-pandemic years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-3.png))**\n\n> In the past few months, we have consistently checked in on the ratio of initial jobless claims to continuing claims (both seasonally adjusted) as a measure of the lack of follow-through of the former to the latter. With last week's very strong initial claims number that was more reflective of the still strong continuing claims number, that ratio has now come back in line with the historical average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Market Rebounds 28.2% After Midterm Year Down YTD Q3\n\n> S&P 500 closed September down -24.8% year-to-date \u2013 the 4th worst YTD Q3 performance since 1930. Since WWII (1946) when S&P 500 was down YTD at the end of Q3 in midterm year it gained 28.2% on average over the next 5 quarters with no losses.\n\n> In all 23 years the following Q4 was up 69.6 % of the time for an average gain of 3.1%. Subsequent Q1s were up only 52.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.7%. The following Q2s gained ground 65.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.9% and then next years were up 73.9% of the time for an average gain of 11.9%.\n\n> But the record for midterm years down at the end of Q3 is better. Of those nine midterm years highlighted in blue in the table only 1946 into 1947 had no bounce with 1947 closing exactly at the same price as 1946 for S&P. Overall, Q4s were up 88.9% of the time, average gain 7.6%, Q1s up 77.8% of the time, average gain 6.7%, Q2 up 77.8% of the time, average gain 4.6% and next years up 88.9% of the time, average gain 19.2%.\n\n> So, while things look grim out there on Wall Street, economically and globally, odds are we are nearing a bottom and the prospects for Q4 and next year are encouraging, at least historically, seasonally and 4-year cycle-wise. But there is still a lot that needs to go right, and the market likely has further downside left.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2955a1bf91d82825f738089cb2c94ce0/90d88a3fb1e2f0a3-95/s500x750/c22af797617682ab681921a8133e9a89dab34563.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CWBtE0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mSyt6vj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS OUT!](https://i.imgur.com/rvQsqm3.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.10.22 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 10.10.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.11.22 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NuLxFYq.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.11.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/65nFw9J.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.12.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XUeRQFI.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.12.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vggne4x.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.13.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVuHnvM.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.13.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.14.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ePGw0HH.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.14.22 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # JPMorgan Chase & Co. $105.98\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "post_text": "Market Recap - Monday October 12 PLEASE ENJOY!! **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 12, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.\n\nProspects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14.

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.\n\n# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday\u2019s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.\n*****\n> Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.\n*****\n> Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we\u2019re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,\u201d said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.\n*****\n> \u201cI think that tends to turn things around,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.\n*****\n> # Election watch\nMichael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. \u201cMost people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it\u2019s a big event,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.\n*****\n> \u201cWe think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,\u201d he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cIf Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump\u2019s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.\n*****\n> Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what\u2019s worrying it.\n*****\n> \u201cWhat we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,\u201d said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.\n*****\n> \u201cBut the stimulus and election, people can say that\u2019s going to directly relate to earnings,\u201d he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.\n*****\n> Among S&P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. \u201cIf third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Many strategists expect the S&P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it\u2019s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.\n*****\n> \u201cI don\u2019t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,\u201d Townswick said.\n*****\n> The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.\n*****\n> But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.\n*****\n> Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n> Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February\n*****\n> Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.\n*****\n> \u201cThe permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that\u2019s going on in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wb4gd2A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N9GB7pr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/F7N4lcy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/9XvRbwLZ/econcal4.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vxohRfN.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uFKJWI5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Og1iuMy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9A4Jc0z.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/zBTB51gf/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/h4rD0s8N/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/zXGJ2h0v/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/sxw3DfD3/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # September Bears Strike Again\n\n> The September weakness continued with the S&P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&P 500\u2014and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks\u2014this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.\n\n> Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cTo see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn\u2019t be too surprising,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhat might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories\n\n> An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&P\u2019s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cbcf92c83edf8fa419f858f97753f5b3/fc62a1e0362941f1-92/s400x600/14f363a1beca3d2f879a2228394f91ff339b2a37.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # \"Low Energy\" Energy\n\n> US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!\n\n> The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/092520-Energy.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n> October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n> But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n> Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery\n\n> We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n> The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cEven as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it\u2019s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cProgress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it\u2019s likely to be a bumpy ride.\u201d\n\n> Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It\u2019s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it\u2019s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/9QGXxg0h/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hryCCMm.pngg))\n\n> # ***Monday 9.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ymR5Z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.29.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ER6w385.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2YCpFn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b7i1AYQ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1N7dKUo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XL4b2EY.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.2.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Micron Technology, Inc. $49.14\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, June 17th, 2023-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed to start the week: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/16/stock-market-today-live-updates-.html)\n*****\n> Stock futures were little changed Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 54 points, or 0.16%, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.05%. Futures connected to the Nasdaq-100 traded 0.1% higher.\n*****\n> Stocks are coming off a winning week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain 2.3% to notch its best weekly gain since March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.4% and 3.3%, respectively. On Friday, the Dow rose 113.89 points, or 0.33%, while the S&P and Nasdaq slipped 0.1% and 0.18%, respectively.\n*****\n> The moves came on the heels of solid big bank earnings and softer inflation reports that lifted investor sentiment. That heightened some hopes the Federal Reserve may be able to tamp down inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s the Goldilocks scenario, it\u2019s inflation coming down with near record low unemployment,\u201d Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cLast Call\u201d on Friday. \u201cYes, people have some pain ... with prices, but they have jobs. Evidence is increasingly favorable for the soft landing viewpoint, and immaculate disinflation is what has the market going crazy.\u201d\n*****\n> Second-quarter earnings season gains steam this week with results from big financial institutions such as Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Results are also due from United Airlines, Las Vegas Sands and technology giants Tesla and Netflix.\n*****\n> Wall Street are bracing for what be a gloomy season with lower profits. Analysts forecast a more than 7% decline in S&P 500 earnings from a year ago, according to FactSet.\n*****\n> This week also ushers in the Fed\u2019s \u201cblackout period\u201d ahead of its July policy meeting. Traders anticipate a near 97% chance the central bank increases interest rates later this month, after pausing hikes in June, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/SnVyBia.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8wwgPm7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hVuN981.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGfojKF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/E7ZfpG0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/P1p9LDd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/bYPX6n5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zhQPYvL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3dumPC4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CNCzGdM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/96ajmzB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jr3IoGr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/DKsIWF9.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rxOhHCz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Activision Blizzard** \u2014 The video-game maker popped 4% after Microsoft and Sony signed a deal to keep \u201cCall of Duty\u201d on Sony\u2019s PlayStation gaming consoles following Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** ATVI\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=ATVI&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](https://cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Chewy** \u2014 Shares jumped more than 5% after Goldman Sachs upgraded them to buy from neutral.

        "post_text": "Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created. Friday 26 February 2021\n\n*Live Updates*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\n* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Penny stocks are very risky.\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**At Close of Thursday**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* BA\tBoeing Co\t216.45\n* UAL\tUnited Airlines Holdings Inc\t51.78\n* ADBE\tAdobe Inc\t459.16\n* ANSS\tANSYS, Inc.\t338.46\n* ADSK\tAutodesk, Inc.\t284.03\n* PAYC\tPaycom Software Inc\t368.31\n* CRM\t[salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com), inc.\t231.08\n* SNPS\tSynopsys, Inc.\t244.09\n* TSLA\tTesla Inc\t682.22\n* FBHS\tFortune Brands Home & Security Inc\t83.48\n* BBY\tBest Buy Co Inc\t102.94\n* PYPL\tPaypal Holdings Inc\t253.94\n* CTAS\tCintas Corporation\t328.05\n* CPRT\tCopart, Inc.\t106.92\n* HSIC\tHenry Schein, Inc.\t61.89\n* RMD\tResMed Inc.\t194.98\n* WELL\tWelltower Inc\t70.28\n* DHI\tD.

        "post_text": "Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis # Introduction:\n\nGood morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.\n\nAnyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.\n\nThere will be a few questions we are looking to answer:\n\n1. Is there revenue growth?\n2. Is there earnings growth?\n3. Is the company really leveraged?\n4. Is there strong cash flow?\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.\n\n# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:\n\nJohnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is the world\u2019s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:\n\n* pharmaceutical,\n* medical devices and diagnostics,\n* consumer good/discretionary\n\nThe pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \\~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:\n\n* immunology,\n* oncology,\n* neurology,\n* pulmonary,\n* cardiology,\n* metabolic diseases.\n\nThe device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women\u2019s health.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n>\\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  \n>  \n>\\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  \n>  \n>\\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  \n>  \n>\\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n>\\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company\u2019s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  \n>  \n>\\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  \n>  \n>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)\n\n# Financial History:\n\nOne thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.\n\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|\n|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|\n|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|\n|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|\n|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|\n\nThe revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).\n\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|\n|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|\n|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|\n\nIncreases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \\~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.\n\nSo ...\n\n1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes\n2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes\n3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt\n4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes\n\n# Some other numbers:\n\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\n\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|\n|:-|:-|\n|Yield|2.76%|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|\n\nFrom a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.\n\nLet's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)\n\n|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|\n\nDelicious.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nFrom a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Additionally, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.\n\nThere are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Furthermore the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.\n\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!\n\nEDIT: For those than cannot find the poll and are interested, [It can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/jxs9uy/which_of_the_following_would_you_like_to_see_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

        "post_text": "Rate my current Roth IRA dividend portfolio? Rate my current dividend portfolios holdings?\n\nI am 23 and just started my Roth IRA in February and so far have a little over $4,300 deposited (still using 2020 as the deposit year don\u2019t worry)     I am also focused on dividend growth investing as I view it as the safest option I\u2019m willing to do and since it\u2019s my retirement account I do want some safety in it. I also don\u2019t want to just toss it into an index fund as I personally believe I\u2019ll be able to pick the best stocks from each sector (or at least the top 25% in each sector) and outperform the general market as a whole. I also enjoy doing research on companies as it lets me stay up to date on what is driving our society from the business perspective and juxtapose that to my personal perspective. I also have a ton of time to listen to ER\u2019s and read reports done by third parties as I\u2019m often driving long distances for either work or to see friends. There isn\u2019t a day that I\u2019m not looking into at least one of my holdings or potential holdings. I enjoy it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not doing an ETF (I also do have some ETF\u2019s again just for safety\u2019s sake). My portfolio by sector:\n\nCommunication services: VOD, DTEGY. (Going to be adding DIS and either T or VZ)\n\nConsumer Discretionary: NKE, HBI. (Going to be adding MCD, and YUM)\n\nConsumer Staple: MO, KO, PEP. (Going to be adding WMT, BTI, PG, and either COST or TGT)\n\nEnergy: KMI, OKE (going to be looking to add either CVX or XOM depending which is doing more for green energy, same for picking between RDS and BP)\n\nFinancials: AFL, C.

PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.\n\nFederal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage \u201cbillions of pages\u201d of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data \u2013 something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon\u2019s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.\n\n\u201cAs the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we\u2019re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,\u201d said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. \u201cAtomic Canyon\u2019s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters\u2014delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.\u201d\n\nThe Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon\u2019s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.\n\nAs\u00a0California\u2019s\u00a0only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state\u2019s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.\n\nRead more: \n\n[https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/pge-to-deploy-nuclear-specific-ai-at-diablo-canyon-plant/](https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/pge-to-deploy-nuclear-specific-ai-at-diablo-canyon-plant/)\n\n",

Gustavo Arnal, 52, joined Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) in 2020. He previously worked as CFO for cosmetics brand Avon in London and had a 20-year stint with Procter & Gamble (PG.N), according to his LinkedIn profile. On Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), police responded to a 911 call and found a 52-year-old man dead near the building who appeared to suffer injuries from a fall. Police identified the man as Gustavo Arnal. The police statement did not provide further details on the circumstances leading to Arnal's death but added that the New York City Medical Examiner's Office will now determine the cause of the fatality.\n\nOn Aug. 16, Arnal, sold 55,013 shares in the company, Reuters' calculations showed based on SEC filings. The big-box chain - once considered a so-called \"category killer\" in home and bath goods - has seen its fortunes falter after an attempt to sell more of its own brand, or private-label goods. Last week, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would close 150 stores, cut jobs and overhaul its merchandising strategy in an attempt to turn around its money-losing business.\n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/business/bed-bath-beyond-cfo-plunges-death-new-yorks-jenga-tower-reports-2022-09-04/",

By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates). The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company\u2019s promoters. At bottom, the \u201cbusiness model\u201d for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.  \n>  \n>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble. And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns some very old lessons: First, many in Wall Street \u00be a community in which quality control is not prized \u00be will sell investors anything they will buy. Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.\n\nWarren Buffet wrote this in his year 2000 shareholder letter, which I read for the first time today. It was interesting as it might be something to consider and think about as we continue to fly high. I don't profess to knowing anything about valuations, but clearly we have been doing quite well for quite some time. I, for one, am not intelligent enough to try and beat the market so I just DCA into boring ETFs and funds and am satisfied doing so, but nonetheless, these paragraphs were interesting to me as it seemed to be potentially relevant to all of the news that has been coming out lately.  \n\n\nWith so many new traders and so much more ease of access to the world of finance, hopefully, we see even more transparency and ease of access to information, as well. As I continue to learn and understand more I find there is an increased need for the great input and sharing of ideas that a community like this can provide.   \n\n\nI am interested to know if you all think we are at risk of, yet again, replicating what Buffet spoke of in 2000.",

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020.\n\n# **What could be \u2018shocker\u2019 economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.\n*****\n> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.\n*****\n> The market\u2019s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. \u201cI could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.\u201d\n*****\n> # It\u2019s the economy\n> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. \n*****\n> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday\u2019s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.\n*****\n> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product in the second quarter.\n*****\n> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.\n*****\n> For \u201ccar sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThey shut down in every major market. Even though they\u2019re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it\u2019s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.\u201d\n*****\n> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.\n*****\n> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.\n*****\n> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.\n*****\n> \u201cThis week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It\u2019s monumental.\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.\n*****\n> # Stimulus one-two punch\n> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed\u2019s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. \n*****\n> \u201cEven though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.\u201d\n*****\n> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.\n*****\n> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. \u201cThere have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.\u201d\n*****\n> Stovall said it\u2019s likely there will be a lower low. \u201cThe only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,\u201d he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.\n*****\n> # Credit un-crunching\n> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.\n*****\n> \u201cStress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed\u2019s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),\u201d noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GBtm0Ny.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLx1MR7.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/1R4lyRy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mtTslWK.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7RHTBUy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3mrVvS.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R1BOiXV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WTuO4fr.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/q0iWKbS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pnJXRXy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9T9bEYz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/qMxQyex.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Will the Fed\u2019s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?\n\n> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it\u2019s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\n> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.\n\n> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the \u201cmoney printing.\u201d Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. \u201cThe massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve\u2014in concert with fiscal stimulus\u2014surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,\u201d noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed\u2019s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed\u2019s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday\u2019s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets\u2014both stocks and bonds\u2014may be beginning to sniff that out.\n\n*****\n\n# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims\n\n> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one\u2019s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.\n\n> \u201cThe personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cThis is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.\u201d Per LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it\u2019s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.\n\n> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.\n\n> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We\u2019ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it\u2019s not because they\u2019re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.\n\n*****\n\n# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity\n\n> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.\n\n> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82\u2014besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants\u2014both retail investors and institutions\u2014and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.\n\n> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.\n\n> \u201cIn volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren\u2019t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,\u201d noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. \u201cImproving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.\u201d\n\n> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn\u2019t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.\n\n> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23\u2014including buying large amounts of corporate bonds\u2014are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank\u2019s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren\u2019t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market\n\n> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?\n\n> \u201cAlthough market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you\u2019d be down 27% per year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.\n\n*****\n\n# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying\n\n> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.\n\n> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Dow.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$RH** \n> * **$BB** \n> * **$VFF** \n> * **$CHWY** \n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$WBA** \n> * **$PAYS** \n> * **$TTNP** \n> * **$STZ** \n> * **$CALM** \n> * **$GNLN** \n> * **$CSU** \n> * **$CAG** \n> * **$MKC** \n> * **$RMBL** \n> * **$GPL** \n> * **$HEXO** \n> * **$PVH** \n> * **$DARE** \n> * **$CTEK** \n> * **$CYD** \n> * **$NVCN** \n> * **$LW** \n> * **$AYI** \n> * **$ICLK** \n> * **$ALPN** \n> * **$APOG** \n> * **$UNF** \n> * **$EAST** \n> * **$SMTS** \n> * **$CSSE** \n> * **$SCHN** \n> * **$LNDC** \n> * **$NG** \n> * **$RECN** \n> * **$EDAP** \n> * **$APTX** \n> * **$ASND** \n> * **$VRNT** \n> * **$MOTS** \n> * **$VERO**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g5GXYu6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Sm5LctR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.30.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qr7snKw.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/T3P5Zde.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.31.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2gmrJMw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.31.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SW9tal3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EMVEv8d.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jUrq9C5.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DDXmPgK.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rzMu8Tn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/G3f55Vs.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.3.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# RH $110.93\n> **RH (RH)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:20 PM ET on Monday, March 30, 2020.

        "post_text": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n> \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n> \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.\n*****\n> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n> # Jobs report\n> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n> \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n> \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n> \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n> \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n> In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-14-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful?

        "post_text": "The perfect time for long term investors to buy their favourite growth stocks?   \nSince Feb 2021, at that first sniff of inflation and the prospect of interest rate rises, growth stocks have seen a continual and quite brutal decline with many well over 50% down from their ATH's and some even as far as 80%.   \n\n\nIf you go back in time to a year ago today, these boards were full of bull cases for these rapidly accelerating stocks. Companies with revenue growth of 40%+ YoY, terrific balance sheets, good business models in growing markets still in the infancy of their business life cycles . All the type of things a person wishing to buy stocks and hold for the long term absolutely love to see. Fast forward to today and you can hardly give these types of stock away. Sentiment could not be lower. Which is exactly the reason I have decided to take the funds out of my ISA (which was essentially losing me money anyway) and put the whole thing into growth stocks that I really love.   \n\n\nStocks like Pinterest for instance; its trading at a valuation that it was in 2019, at a time when its revenues are half of what it is now, its began to prove it can turn a profit, massive companies like Microsoft and PAYPAL are sniffing around wanting to buy it. Yet here it is, 60% down from its highs, trading at 2019 levels, and its making more money than ever, with no sign of that slowing down as it continues to generate more revenue per customer every quarter.   \n\n\nThe market it currently full of stocks like this. The likes of Square, Palantir, Crowdstrike, Draftkings, cloudfare, SoFi; all the stocks that got people so excited 12 months ago. They are all making more money now (quite a lot more) than they were this time last year but are trading at half the valuations. This is exactly the scenario people should want. All those reasons for optimism last year are still valid, arguably more so.   \n\n\nFor me, ive decided to sell some of my safer investments and open big positions in some of these stocks now with the intention of holding them for a long time. If they market continues to drop, thats fine, I will buy more. Because at these valuations, I feel a heck of a lot more comfortable.",

I'm not a Cramer fan, but good that at least someone notable likes the stock, so it's not like I'm on a lone quixotic quest.\n\n**Cons for CVS:**\n\n* The convenience store portion is crap.  Every CVS I've been to is ghost-town.  I am shocked they are still in business.  I mean, a bag of candies that cost like $2 in Walmart is like $4 in CVS.  It's nuts.\n* Health insurance competition is great.  Humana, UNH, Wellpoint, local small timers, HMOs, etc.\n\nFor PG:\n\n**Pros for PG:**\n\n* Well-established brands\n* Diversified brands\n* Staples (even if economy goes sour, people still need to brush their teeth)\n\n**Cons for PG:** \n\n* Tariff exposure\n* Millennial birth rate is not very good, from what I heard, and that affects their baby supplies business\n* Lack of innovation re new products \n\nThoughts on the two stocks and price targets?",

But I need to make sure I'm getting a steady and safe stream of baseline income from my investments to take care of fixed expenses.\n\nWhat do you think of the strategy of selecting say, 10 of the top dividend stocks that are safe (good companies) and have a good track record on keeping or raising their dividends. For example, Verizon, Enterprise Products Partners, KMI, and others that pay upward of 6% or higher on dividends. I wouldn't distribute the 300k evenly across the 10 (or so) dividend stocks, but I would diversify to a great extent to protect myself from a company going under. That way, I'm getting high dividend returns even if the market takes a downturn (and hoping companies don't lower their dividends if that happens).\n\nI know it's not a 100% safe strategy, but what do you think? Bonds at 4-5% is a bit too low if I can make 6-7% or higher on dividend stocks and get some protection against a potential market downturn.\n\nI'd appreciate anyone's thoughts, thanks!\n\n**UPDATE:** Thank you for all of your thoughts! I think what I may end up doing is an ETF like VOO or VTI, and as it makes money, secure my profits so that when the market takes a downturn I've built up some profit to keep the steady stream of income coming in. So, every time VOO makes me say 5k, I pull that out and put it in a money market account. \"Skim off the top\" to keep from market downturns forcing me to potentially dig into the principal. Anyone like that idea? Stock market returns are just too high to not put the 300k there. So long as I build up a security blanket against downturns, putting the 300k in the S&P seems the best choice and taking profits regularly. And if ever I don't need the money and my side job is enough, I'll just leave the 300k in there. VOO has some risk, but is safe long term, just have to weather the valleys as they come.  \n\nD.",

As a consequence of likely wildfire liability and investigation, Pacific Gas & Electric has cut its dividend to 0, their bonds were downgraded to junk status, they filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, and shares have plunged. There are apparently several options for how things will proceed, depending on regulators and other factors. But whether they are converted into a public utility, bailed out by the government, issue bonds to fund liabilities, or vanish entirely, those Californians will still need electricity. Companies like Clearway Energy (CWEN) supply energy to PG&E (PCG) through long-term contracts (power purchase agreements). CWEN receives roughly 20-25% of its revenue from PCG, and its shares have fallen roughly 30% from its 52-week high, with a majority of that directly attributable to plunges following PCG news. So it seems that the market has already priced in complete failure of those contracts, but however the PCG situation shakes out, CWEN's assets will still be located in the region, ready to supply energy to the next provider. This would apply to other companies whose shares have dropped on PCG's major down days, like Atlantic Yield (AY), another yieldco with a single PCG contract. I'm probably missing some critical fact because my knowledge on the situation is very limited. Does anyone have more insight? In a worst case scenario, why couldn't these Yieldcos just renegotiate or issue fresh contracts with a new provider to replace PCG's (hypothetically) cancelled contracts?",

The Dividend Champions have raised dividends for the past 25 years, but they don\u2019t have to be an S&P 500 stock. And there are no liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Dividend Achievers \u2013 These stocks have increased dividends for the past 10 years, and the liquidity requirements aren\u2019t tough. Daily trading needs to be above the $500,000 mark.\n\nThe Dividend Contenders - Just like the Achievers, these stocks have raised dividends every year between 10 and 24 years. Unlike the Achievers, there are no liquidity restrictions\u2026 the stock does not need $500,000 worth of trading every day.\n\nThe Dividend Challengers - These stocks have raised their dividends between 5 and 9 years in a row.\n\nNow that you know where to find stocks that have a history of raising their dividends every year, here\u2019s how to get the breakthrough you need for your portfolio.\n\nIt\u2019s all about balance. It\u2019s a simple lineup of different kinds of dividend stocks that offset strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nUGI Corp (UGI)\n\nDividend Yield: 2.38%\nAnnual Payout: $0.87\nPayout Ratio: 46%\nP/E: 19.24\nAlliance Resource Partners (ARLP)\n\nDividend Yield: 6.30%\nAnnual Payout: $2.55\nPayout Ratio: 53.5%\nP/E: 8.96\nGlobal Partners LP (GLP)\n\nDividend Yield: 7.08%\nAnnual Payout: $2.61\nPayout Ratio: 74.4%\nP/E: 8.73\n\nIf you really want to read more go here to learn more about dividend stocks!\n\nhttp://www.dividendstocksresearch.com",

        "post_text": "Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.\n\nRECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically \"perfect company.\" The dream attributes of such a company go as:\n\n***It Sounds Dull\u2014Or Even Better Ridiculous:***\n\nCompanies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.\n\nMy examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)\n\n***It Does Something Dull:***\n\nCompanies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.\n\nMy examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)\n\n***It Does Something Disagreeable:***\n\nBusinesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.\n\nMy Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)\n\n***It\u2019s a Spinoff:***\n\nCorporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.\n\nFound a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)\n\n***The Institutions Don\u2019t Own It, and The Analysts Don\u2019t Follow It:***\n\nStocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These \"ignored\" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.\n\nMy examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)\n\n***The Rumors Abound: It\u2019s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***\n\nLynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.\n\nMy examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)\n\n***There\u2019s Something Depressing About It:***\n\nCompanies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.\n\nMy examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)\n\n***It\u2019s a No-Growth Industry:***\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.\n\nMy examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)\n\n***It\u2019s Got a Niche:***\n\nA strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits\n\nMy examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)\n\n***People Have to Keep Buying It:***\n\nLynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.\n\nMy examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)\n\n***It's a User of Technology:***\n\nCompanies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.\n\nMy examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)\n\n***The Insiders are Buyers:***\n\nInsider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nMy examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)\n\n***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***\n\nCompanies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions\u200b.\n\nMy examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",

I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.\n\nMy main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I\u2019ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don\u2019t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:\n\n- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN\n\nWhen choosing stocks I didn\u2019t really look through the financial sheets. I simply bought companies that looked relatively stable and well known anywhere I go. Let me know what you think!",

        "post_text": "Procter & Gamble sales disappoint as price hikes slow down Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years hiking prices across its portfolio, from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.\n\nThe company\u2019s prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period, although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn\u2019t institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.\n\nDespite its disappointing sales, the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.\n\nShares of the company fell 1% in premarket trading.\n\nHere\u2019s what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected\n\nRevenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected\n\nP&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion, or $1.52 per share, up from $3.4 billion, or $1.37 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales rose 1% to $20.41 billion. Organic sales, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased 3% in the quarter.\n\nBut the company\u2019s quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October, executives said that they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in, the company hasn\u2019t yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.\n\nHowever, three of P&G\u2019s divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment, which includes Olay and Pantene, saw volume rise 1%, fueled by innovation in personal care. The company\u2019s grooming business, home to its Gillette and Venus razors, reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care, which includes Febreze and Swiffer, saw 1% volume growth.\n\nBut P&G\u2019s health care and baby, feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.\n\nGeography also played a role in the company\u2019s lackluster sales. China, the company\u2019s second-largest market, is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skincare. Schulten also said that some markets, particularly in the Middle East, have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe impact is visible but limited, and we expect it to lessen, obviously, hopefully as these tensions ease over time,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the U.S., P&G\u2019s largest market, the company\u2019s volume grew 3%. Schulten said that the U.S. consumer isn\u2019t trading down or changing shopping behavior.\n\n\u201cConsumers don\u2019t want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the full year, P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11%, up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2%, up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.\n\nP&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs, up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That\u2019s a reversal from the last two fiscal years, when commodity costs weighed on the company, leading to price hikes.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/19/procter-gamble-pg-q3-2024-earnings.html",

        "post_text": "Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.\n\nOne such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.\n\nNow I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.\n\nSo what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.\n\nThis yielded the following table:\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|\n|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|\n|3|MSFT|418.35|459.66|91.01%|34|14|13|41.18%|\n|4|NVDA|117.02|125.69|93.10%|38|14|15|36.84%|\n|5|AMZN|186.98|206.43|90.58%|47|15|28|31.91%|\n|6|META|474.83|490.04|96.90%|63|21|34|33.33%|\n|7|GOOG|173.15|185.45|93.37%|5|0|3|0.00%|\n|8|BRK.B|438.5|441.47|99.33%|6|1|3|16.67%|\n|9|LLY|804.27|817.03|98.44%|22|9|8|40.91%|\n|10|AVGO|160.68|180.62|88.96%|29|10|17|34.48%|\n|11|JPM|212.8|200.66|106.05%|28|9|13|32.14%|\n|12|TSLA|232.07|189.09|122.73%|23|0|0|0.00%|\n|13|UNH|576.16|569.6|101.15%|22|11|11|50.00%|\n|14|XOM|118.59|122.83|96.55%|25|5|11|20.00%|\n|15|V|265.67|282.26|94.12%|39|13|22|33.33%|\n|16|JNJ|157.85|158.53|99.57%|23|4|8|17.39%|\n|17|PG|160.76|161.5|99.54%|22|6|4|27.27%|\n|18|MA|463.71|474.87|97.65%|39|14|20|35.90%|\n|19|HD|368.16|355.97|103.42%|33|12|12|36.36%|\n|20|COST|822|886.84|92.69%|29|7|11|24.14%|\n|21|WMT|68.64|68.29|100.51%|32|8|7|25.00%|\n|22|MRK|113.13|132.14|85.61%|21|4|7|19.05%|\n|23|BAC|40.31|41.95|96.09%|30|6|16|20.00%|\n|24|CVX|160.47|167.84|95.61%|24|6|10|25.00%|\n|25|NFLX|628.35|640.43|98.11%|41|11|14|26.83%|\n|26|KO|66.74|64.8|102.99%|25|5|7|20.00%|\n|27|CRM|258.8|274.18|94.39%|45|16|25|35.56%|\n|28|ADBE|551.65|566.58|97.36%|31|11|14|35.48%|\n|29|PEP|172.67|168.65|102.38%|22|10|10|45.45%|\n|30|TMO|613.34|629.42|97.45%|15|8|6|53.33%|\n|31|AMD|144.48|175.48|82.33%|31| | |0.00%|\n|32|LIN|453.5|475.32|95.41%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|33|ORCL|139.45|140.03|99.59%|36|10|16|27.78%|\n|34|WFC|59.34|59.8|99.23%|31|4|8|12.90%|\n|35|ACN|330.62|348.01|95.00%|29|7|9|24.14%|\n|36|CSCO|48.45|50.56|95.83%|27|8|11|29.63%|\n|37|MCD|265.4|276.47|96.00%|33|8|15|24.24%|\n|38|QCOM|180.95|191.24|94.62%|23|2|7|8.70%|\n|39|GE|170.2|171.93|98.99%|17|5| |29.41%|\n|40|ABT|105.94|124.37|85.18%|20|7|6|35.00%|\n|41|TXN|203.81|187.18|108.88%|32|6|8|18.75%|\n|42|DHR|277.08|284.09|97.53%|17|7|6|41.18%|\n|43|AMGN|332.47|320.24|103.82%|25|3|7|12.00%|\n|44|INTU|647.35|711.36|91.00%|22|6|3|27.27%|\n|45|PM|115.16|115.74|99.50%|18|2|7|11.11%|\n|46|PFE|30.54|29.38|103.95%|22|2|11|9.09%|\n|47|IBM|192.14|172.59|111.33%|25|4|4|16.00%|\n|48|DIS|93.69|123.11|76.10%|30|5|10|16.67%|\n|49|VZ|40.52|45.6|88.86%|32|2|6|6.25%|\n|50|CAT|346.2|337.62|102.54%|24|4|7|16.67%|\n|51|NOW|814.39|807.1|100.90%|34|13|17|38.24%|\n|52|AMAT|212.2|248.8|85.29%|21|4|15|19.05%|\n|53|GS|509.03|476.64|106.80%|27|4|7|14.81%|\n|54|CMCSA|41.27|46.36|89.02%|31|12|18|38.71%|\n|55|SPGI|484.73|521.39|92.97%|15|1|9|6.67%|\n|56|RTX|117.49|103.93|113.05%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|57|ISRG|444.61|471.87|94.22%|17|6|5|35.29%|\n|58|NEE|76.39|80.23|95.21%|15|5|8|33.33%|\n|59|UNP|246.73|242.11|101.91%|29|5|7|17.24%|\n|60|AXP|253.04|253.26|99.91%|28|6|4|21.43%|\n|61|LOW|245.51|250.99|97.82%|32|8|10|25.00%|\n|62|T|19.25|19.3|99.74%|30|6|3|20.00%|\n|63|HON|204.75|226.96|90.21%|20|7|9|35.00%|\n|64|UBER|64.47|79.96|80.63%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|65|VRTX|495.72|483.91|102.44%|27|10|12|37.04%|\n|66|MS|103.21|105.64|97.70%|27|3|14|11.11%|\n|67|TJX|113.02|107.04|105.59%|27|9|14|33.33%|\n|68|INTC|30.74|38.02|80.85%|41| |18|0.00%|\n|69|BKNG|3715.01|4192.39|88.61%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|70|PGR|214.12|237.47|90.17%|19|5|4|26.32%|\n|71|C|64.88|71.01|91.37%|29|5|12|17.24%|\n|72|ELV|532.03|599.13|88.80%| | | |#DIV/0!|\n|73|BLK|876.5|936.85|93.56%|15|3|9|20.00%|\n|74|PLD|126.05|135.68|92.90%|18|4|8|22.22%|\n|75|LMT|541.92|535.31|101.23%|22|7| |31.82%|\n|76|ETN|304.79|345.86|88.13%|24|3|4|12.50%|\n|77|REGN|1079.19|1104.34|97.72%|26|7|6|26.92%|\n|78|MU|109.82|174.41|62.97%|31|8|20|25.81%|\n|79|CB|275.66|277.84|99.22%|19|5|11|26.32%|\n|80|SYK|327.45|378.81|86.44%|27|11|6|40.74%|\n|81|ADI|231.38|255.84|90.44%|26|6|10|23.08%|\n|82|LRCX|921.24|1041.75|88.43%|19|3|12|15.79%|\n|83|MMC|222.57|223.48|99.59%|19|4|7|21.05%|\n|84|BSX|73.88|87.57|84.37%|24|10|8|41.67%|\n|85|MDT|80.32|92.43|86.90%|23|4|7|17.39%|\n|86|BA|190.6|219.35|86.89%|25|7|7|28.00%|\n|87|ADP|262.62|264.65|99.23%|18|1|1|5.56%|\n|88|AMT|220.4|230.39|95.66%|22|7|14|31.82%|\n|89|PANW|324.73|343.43|94.55%|41|13|16|31.71%|\n|90|KLAC|823.07|868.07|94.82%|14|2|4|14.29%|\n|91|BX|142.15|135.47|104.93%|14|6|6|42.86%|\n|92|CI|348.67|393.25|88.66%|17|6|7|35.29%|\n|93|BMY|47.56|50.47|94.23%|22|5|4|22.73%|\n|94|GILD|76.06|81.02|93.88%|28|2|11|7.14%|\n|95|SCHW|65.19|73.89|88.23%|19|5|9|26.32%|\n|96|DE|371.98|422.99|87.94%|22|4|3|18.18%|\n|97|FI|163.57|177.14|92.34%|19|1|2|5.26%|\n|98|UPS|130.37|144.61|90.15%|26|3|2|11.54%|\n|99|SO|83.52|79.51|105.04%|17|1|4|5.88%|\n|100|TMUS|182.28|197.95|92.08%|30|7|16|23.33%|\n|101|COP|111.2|141.51|78.58%|21|6|9|28.57%|\n\n\nBased on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria.

        "post_text": "I'm an astrophysicist and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses based on kinematic principles: comments welcome! (March 17, 2019) Third post of the series! Thanks for everyone\u2019s wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's \"velocity\" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its \"acceleration\" (%/day\\^2), and the third derivative is the \u201cjerk\u201d, or change in acceleration (%/day\\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.\n\nThanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github:\u00a0[https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\\_optimize\\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)\n2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here\u2019s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \\*on average\\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.\n3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI>70 to be overbought, and RSI<30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it\u2019s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI>70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!\n4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\\_Kinematics\\_of\\_stock\\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)\n\nCheers!\n\nDisclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSMA = simple

        "post_text": "A plea for the dividend Many investors nail down \"dividend investing\" to a % number. In my opinion the current dividend yield isn't even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You're not investing in a dividend, you're investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it's profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you've taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you've collected enough dividends along the way.\n\nPersonally, I don't invest in companies which don't pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don't manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.\n\nSome dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they've been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren't sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don't know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it's profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I'd take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.\n\n**The dividend is what keeps things real** and I don't only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). \n\nBy holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don't have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don't have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn't because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. \n\nI believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don't have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly.",

        "post_text": "There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks. An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?\n\nThe answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]\n\nThis post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.\n\n**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**\n\n[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)\n\nFrom another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):\n\n> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000\u00ae Index) led both large caps (S&P 500\u00ae) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap\u00ae) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.\n\n\nBut even outside of recessions, the outperformance is [robust across many decades](https://i.imgur.com/W0sAt4K.png), though. [Another graph](https://i.imgur.com/0OaFiH1.png),  and [another](https://i.imgur.com/HBkJ6aA.png).\n\n**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**\n\n Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)\n\nThis has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [\"Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk\"](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]\n\nThus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.\n\n**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**\n\n- US small cap value is relatively insulated from the broader global economy, unlike the enormous multinational firms dominating the S&P 500. They do not face the currency risks that are currently hitting large cap company's revenues. [Source](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/insights/article/why-small-cap-value-now.do) and [source](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/small-cap-interview).\n- Right now, the problem in the US economy is its strong labor market. Small cap value stocks see more earnings growth (relative to large firms) in such periods. \n- [Expected earnings for small caps](https://i.imgur.com/yJ1DPGZ.png) from [this source](https://www.lordabbett.com/en-us/financial-advisor/insights/markets-and-economy/a-strengthening-case-for-small-cap-stocks.html).\n- [Returns to expect](https://i.imgur.com/4sc85CZ.png) given these valuations in small caps. (Same link)\n- \"In 2022 small caps suffered their worst first-half drawdown since the inception of the Russell 2000\u00ae Index in 1978, falling 23.4%.\" [Source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/).\n- They are at historically cheap levels: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/L2gY3Xl.png). In this table, we see the ratio of valuations of large cap to small cap stocks. [Higher = small cap is cheaper]. [Source](https://www.aaii.com/investor-update/article/15037-small-cap-stocks-are-cheap-relative-to-large-cap-stocks).\n- [Here is a measure](https://i.imgur.com/XGLxpPG.png) of the cheapness of value stocks (large or small) compared to growth. We are in a very expensive period historically speaking.

I'll include a few of those quotes:\n\n> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.\n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/e3fb3c34-b982-4827-9762-f5b9a8d33dc5)\n\n> \n> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks \u2014 Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks \u2014 the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.\n\n[Source](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/)\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst:\n\n>  Meanwhile, small cap stocks trade at much more attractive valuation levels than large-caps, according to the note. The S&P SmallCap 600 trades at a P/E multiple of 11x, which is near its cheapest level of the last 30 years. \"This multiple also represents a 30% discount to the S&P 500,\" Kostin said.  That's the largest discount since the dot-com bubble, and if earnings don't deteriorate meaningfully from here, it could represent a big opportunity for investors.\n\n[Source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-valuations-rich-small-caps-value-interest-rates-2022-10)\n\n**Cheapness is even more pronounced in Europe**\n\n\n> Arnold also writes \u201cvalue stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they\u2019ve actually de-rated over the last five years.\u201d\n\n> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: \u201cThe Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!\u201d\n> \n> Finally, Arnold writes that \u201cover the last five years Europe\u2019s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!\u201d \n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) \n\nAnother [valuation graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png) for Europe valuations\n\n**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**\n\n>  After Japan's bubble burst, from 1990 to 2019, Japanese total country returns averaged 0.6%. Japanese small cap value averaged 5.13% and Japanese value stocks averaged 4%. During 2000-2010,  US small cap value grew 7.94% on average and US value stocks grew 4.56% on average, in contrast to a declining/flat S&P 500. \n\n\nSource: Ben Felix's various videos on small cap value.\n\nYou aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.\n\n**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**\n\nBecause market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?\n\n**Ticker recommendations**:\n\nI use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.\n\nI explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. \n\n> They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies \"tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning\ntheir prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent\nunderperformance.\" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.\n\n> [You can read about their approach to investing here](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/dam/ac/pdfs/ipro/viewpoint/iuo/scientific-approach-to-investing.pdf).",

        "post_text": "I'm an astrophysicist (read: data-scientist) and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses: comments welcome! (March 15, 2019) This is my second post of this series! If the community finds this useful, I'd be happy to continue posting (perhaps daily?).\n\nExplanation: my approach is based on simple moving averages (SMA). Typical analysts use either the 50-day or 200-day SMA, but there is value in averaging over other periods as well. My approach is to run a loop from 200 to 10 days, and for each period compute the SMA, it's derivative, and second derivative. I then plug in today's date, and take weighted averages of the current SMA and its derivatives. The average derivative is essentially the stock's \"velocity\" (in %/day), and the average 2nd derivative is its \"acceleration\" (%/day\\^2).\n\nThis approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations on financials, etc. It is simply based on the history of each ticker. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite ticker added, just let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarch 15th update: thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements:\n\n1. I changed the minimum SMA to 10 days instead of 5 (this is to be consistent with the target date predictions) thanks u/kotixa for inspiring this change\n2. I am now taking weighted averages, instead of applying equal weights. The weights are set as the inverse period used to calculate the SMAs. This essentially weights recent trends higher than long-term trends, similar to the momentum-based strategies suggested yesterday by u/velos00 and u/yebidepoj\n3. I added target prices and % change for 10 trading days in the future incorporating up to the second derivative. This should help to track how well this strategy is doing at predicting future moves, and to define entry/exit points. Thanks to suggestions by u/hcasaomlitter and u/kotixa! This will enable backtesting in the future (also possible now if anyone wants to look at the source code and run their own historical tests).\n4. A quick note about backtesting, which has been a frequently asked question: while this needs to be done more rigorously in the future, a quick example from 10 days in the past predicted an 8.5% rise in the sum price of the top 10 listed tickers. The actual rise was closer to 5%. More historical testing, and tracking of the comparison of predictions to actual performance in the future, are certainly required!\n\nMarch 16th update: github link to source code: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\\_optimize\\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)\n\nCheers!\n\nDisclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these \"predictions\" will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.\n\nUpdate: Wow, thanks for the excellent response everyone! And to the kind stranger who golded me (I've never been golded before!) I will do my best to keep this service going in the future! To make matters easier for mobile users, in the future I will post the top ten in the main post and the full list in a comment.\n\n1 --- GH --- price = 101.5 --- sma = 67.3 --- d/dt = 1.55%/day ---

        "post_text": "Tesla, diluted share count, and ARK research. Let's talk about ARK for a moment.  ARK is very open with their research, which is more than can be said for most actively managed funds.  A few months ago, they released a Tesla valuation model that can be found on their github [here](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model).  I don't care to comment on the assumptions of their business -- as 2025 hasn't yet come, it would just be my word against ARKs.  There is, however, an interesting assumption at the bottom of their Tesla valuation that I *do* want to talk about.  They assume shares outstanding will increase from 960M at the end of Q4 2020 to 964M in 2025.  This is integral to their per share price target.  \n\nLet's check how Arkk is doing on that assumption.  In terms of financial quarters, we're 10% of the way to the end of 2025, Tesla should be around 960.4M shares.  According to [Tesla's most recent 10-Q, pg. 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000524/tsla-20210630.htm), there are 990M shares outstanding as of July 22.  That's 7x the shares ARK assumed in 10% of the time.  But Tesla hasn't issued any new shares, so what exactly is going on here?  \n\nThe answer lies in the diluted share count.  Diluted share count includes all sources of additional shares that could be converted or exercised, e.g. convertible bonds, Employee stock options, warrants, etc.  These instruments are exercised over time, and the basic share count will tend towards the diluted count.  On pg. 13 of the 10-Q, we can see that including dilutive effects, Tesla's share count is closer to 1.12B.    \n\nThe utility of the diluted share count should be obvious.  If one is modeling a security five years out, especially if the projected price movement is bullish, it should be assumed that all outstanding stock options, warrants and convertibles will be exercised and added to the share count to create an accurate price target.  20% of Tesla's outstanding dilutive instruments have been exercised in the last six months.  Diluted share counts tend to catch up quickly.  \n\nWhy would companies dilute their shares like this?  Employee stock options can pad cashflow and convertible bonds' optionality can decrease interest coupon rates.  These are highly desirable among growth companies with poor cashflow and low/nonexistent credit ratings.  Tesla suffered from both of these problems for many years.\n  \nWhich brings us back to ARK.  ARK largely deals in early stage startups and growth companies.  They should see a lot of these instruments being used.  They should be intimately familiar with the effects of SBC, convertibles, and warrants.  Yet, they didn't consider these effects in their last two models.  This leads to three possible conclusions:  \n1) No one at ARK realized the model was made using the basic share count.  \n\n2) ARK intentionally used the basic share count to increase their price target.\n\n3) ARK's security analysts don't know the importance of using a diluted share count in this situation.  \n\nNone of these options paint a particularly rosy picture of the firm.  If you invest in ARK, this is the quality of research being used to make investing decisions.  Caveat Emptor.",

(PEP)**\n\nPepsiCo is a multinational food, snack and beverage corporation responsible for some of the most popular brand names in the world. Their umbrella of products includes Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Gatorade, Quaker Foods, Cheetos, Lays, Doritos, Aquafina, and many more. Compared to their main competitor, Coca-Cola, they offer a far more diverse catalog of products thanks to their expansion into the food and snack industries. \n\nIf we compare 5 year stock growth, PEP is up 35% over that span while Coca-Cola (KO) is up only 16%. Looking at annual sales growth over the past 5 years, PEP is up 0.1% while KO is actually down 4.1%. Additionally, PEP's 5 year dividend growth rate is 8.41% while KO's is 5.57%. While these numbers are relatively close over a small time span, I think the long term edge goes to PepsiCo unless Coca-Cola can expand their product offerings.\n\n**PEP Financials Breakdown** \n\n- Frito-Lay North America - $16.8B = 25% of revenue\n- Quaker Foods North America - $2.7B = 4% of revenue\n- PepsiCo Beverages North America - $21.5B = 32% of revenue\n- Latin America - $7.4B = 11% of revenue\n- Europe - $12.1B = 18% of revenue\n- Other - $6.7B = 10% of revenue\n\nFood accounted for 54% of revenue, beverages accounted for 46%\n\nUS Sales accounted for 58% of revenue, international sales accounted for 42%\n\nNet Sales: $67.2B in 2019, (+3.9% vs 2018)\n\nOperating Profit: $10.6B in 2019, (No change vs 2018) \n\nAssets/Liabilities: $5.5B in cash & cash equivalents; $29.1B in long term debt with $18.9B not due until after 2024\n\n[Data from 2019 Annual Report](https://www.pepsico.com/docs/album/annual-reports/pepsico-inc-2019-annual-report.pdf?sfvrsn=ea470b5_2)\n\n**Other Information**\n\nPepsiCo is a dividend aristocrat (25+ years of increasing dividends) with a current streak of 48 years, meaning they are only 2 years away from reaching dividend king status. The stock's current yield is 3.08%. [A good resource on Dividend Aristocrats from one of my favorite sites can be found here](https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-aristocrats-list/)\n\nPepsiCo has 22 individual brands that each generate at least $1B in annual revenue, 8 of which are food/snack brands. Coca-Cola is close behind with 20 $1B brands.\n\nPepsiCo recently acquired [Rockstar Energy Beverages](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814462332/pepsico-seeks-boost-in-energy-drink-market-with-purchase-of-rockstar) for $3.85B, expanding their product offerings as well as strengthening their presence in the energy drink market.\n\nAs of 2018, PepsiCo sourced 76% of its power via wind energy, with goals of transitioning 100% of US direct operations to renewable electricity. After past controversies over their environmental footprint, its good to see them working towards a more sustainable future.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nWhen it comes to the consumer sector stocks PepsiCo is one of my favorites, right up there next to Costco (COST) and Procter & Gamble (PG). PepsiCo's stock has been a slow and steady mover over the past decade (up about 109%), and with a worldwide market to sell their products I think they will continue to see increases in sales. Their growth combined with dividend payouts make them an attractive option for long-term investors, although they are probably better suited for more conservative strategies. Their push to market and develop healthier products will leave them well-positioned to capture additional market share, as well as protect them from any declines in sales of soft drinks and other sugary beverages.\n\nWhile I own both PEP and KO in my portfolio, I'm more bullish on PEP. I think KO's smaller collection of brands will limit their long term growth (unless they make some big moves in the next several years). Both companies have worked towards expanding into healthier beverages, but PEP's large catalog of snack and food products still offer a wider economic moat. My favorite fact about PEP (as mentioned above) is their 22 individual brands that each generate $1B+ in sales. We always talk about diversifying our portfolios, but it isn't often that a company can be as equally diverse in terms of its revenue streams.",

        "post_text": "Stocks with good dividends without debt drag, a prep for recession & USA bond problems Hello, in a world of debt with a probable 'recession by design' coming,\r  \nI have some parameters of low-debt consumer staples and some defensive names.\r  \n  These are what I am most interested in now.  This is due to \r  \n\\*- declining USA consumer confidence\r  \n\\*- Bankruptcy of property development majors in China\r  \n\\*- the fastest rise in interest rates in decades\r  \n\\*- The end of student loan payment respite\r  \n\\*- The continuation of the end of eviction protections (yes those were still in\r  \nplace this year in some liberal states !)\r  \n\\*- The 150,000 jobs added recently was not bad, but it is a declining trend\r  \n\\*- The debt ceiling debacle returns in December\r  \n\r  \n  When a company stares down the barrel of rising interest rates and they\r  \nwant to take on more debt to work on a project like a new product, the situation\r  \nis much worse of the company already has a lot of debt.  So being in a state of\r  \nlow debt gives more growth potential in addition to the obvious safer situation.\r  \n  Comsumer staples stocks do well when people become convinced that a recession\r  \nis coming, and during the recession they tend to stay stable. \r  \n Then you sell these stocks when layoffs start to decline as you are well into the recession itself.\r  \n There are some industries that carry more debt than most.  These are the\r  \nones who consider their revenue streams predictable and reliable.  They can\r  \ntake on debt and be confident that they will be able to meet the financing payments.\r  \nConsumer staples fall into this category, as do utilities.\r  \n  Cyclical industries such as semiconductor capital equipment are ill-advised to\r  \ntake on a lot of debt.\r  \n\r  \n  Numerous consumer staples stocks have debt to equity higher than 100%.\r  \nSurprised?  I still grapple with the fact that Circuit City went under with only\r  \n25% debt to equity reported, and yet many companies trudge on for years with debt\r  \nto equity higher than 100%.  I highlight ones I found that according to Reuters\r  \nhave less debt than that.  I will perhaps stretch perception of what 'low debt'\r  \nmeans and call this <100% = low debt (at least it is in consumer staples land).\r  \nSometimes you see web sites with financial metrics put a '0' for debt, but often\r  \nthat is wrong.  It is better to see a small non-zero number for debt to equity.\r  \nNaturally to be worth investing in it we would like to see a non trivial dividend.\r  \n\r  \nHere is the list, with valuation metrics as of 11/11 thrown in:\r  \n'Back PE' refers to 'Backward looking PE' as opposed to forecasted PE\r  \npr/sls refers to price to sales.  Theorists argue this is the most important value metric.\r  \nI can endeavor to follow up with debt to EBITDA.  EBITDA is 'earnings before interest, taxes,\r  \ndepreciation, and amortization'.  This is another important measure of debt.\r  \nThe two measures of debt total and long term I separate with double slash\r  \nand it does not mean division.\r  \n  A main motivation here is that if you truly believe (as I do) that USA bonds have\r  \ntransitioned to something one should refuse to own at any yield, then these stocks are\r  \none of the best options left to be a store of value in the future.\r  \n\r  \npercent\r  \nsymbol  | Dividend | Back PE | pr/sls | debt to equity |\r  \n|                  |                |            | total//long term\r  \n\\--------|--------------|--------------|---------|----------------|\r\r  \nHormel Foods\r  \nHRL     |  3.38%      |  20.4         |  1.46  | 43//31%\r  \nArcher Daniels Midland (remember the \"Supermarket to the World\" sound byte?)\r  \nADM     |  2.48%      |  10.1        |  0.40  | 34//33%\r  \nKraft Heinz\r  \nKHC     |  4.86%       |  13.6        |  1.49  | 40//39%\r  \nTyson Foods\r  \nTSN     |  4.09%       |  50.0        |  0.31   | 50//47%\r  \nBunge (A seed producer and more for aggie)\r  \nBG      |  2.54%        |   8.1         |  0.25   | 51//39%\r  \nPfizer\r  \nPFE     |  5.56%        |  16.2       |  2.43    | 66//63%\r  \nJohnson and Johnson\r  \nJNJ     |  3.23%         |  28.1       |  4.05    | 42//37%\r  \nMondelez\r  \nMDLZ    |  2.46%     |  20.7       |  2.65    | 70//58%\r  \n\r  \nSome consumer staples and defensives with high debt to equity, for comparison:\r  \npercent\r  \nsymbol  | Dividend | Back PE | pr/sls | debt to equity |\r  \n|                  |                |            | total//long term\r  \n\\------------|---------------|-------------|---------|---------------------|\r  \nAbbvie\r  \nABBV    |   4.47%      |  37.9       |  4.44  | 502//460%\r  \nSysco  (not to be confused with Cisco the networking company)\r  \nSYY     |   2.97%        |  18.9       |  0.44  | 512//503%\r  \n\r  \nGIS, CPB, and CAG have debt to equity that might be viewed as\r reasonable.

I am 25 years old and relatively new to investing. Don't worry, I know about the subject, I've done a lot of research and I've read almost every cornerstone book in the field. First of all, I have to say that I am not an American and I do not live in America. However, inflation rates in my country are highly volatile and the economy is quite bad. That's why I decided to split my stock investments into two. I plan to invest 50% in American stock markets and 50% in domestic stock markets. I will invest in companies that have solid ideas and products in the domestic stock market and that I trust in the long-term income return. Today I want to talk to you about the American stocks part. I do not have proper knowledge on this subject and I do not know how much my research will lead me to the right path. I would like to discuss with you a few stocks I have chosen in this field and consult with you on the points that I did not realize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile choosing these stocks, I paid attention to the following:\n\n1. Have I heard of the company before?\n2. Do I use the company's products?\n3. Who are the competitors of the company and which do people prefer?\n4. In which field does the company serve? (Food, clothing, health, etc.)\n5. How is the company value, total share value and brand value?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you pay attention to the criteria I use, you may notice that I cannot consider every stock because I stay away from areas that I have no idea about. When choosing companies, I chose relatively stable stocks. I'm not looking for high returns. I want my investments to beat inflation or lose value relatively less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stocks I chose; **Crocs(CROX), Protecter & Gamble(PG), McDonald's(MCD), Starbucks(SBUX)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stayed away from tech stocks. I tried to think a bit like Warren Buffet. I tried to analyze company revenues and customer profiles. Please note that I have built this portfolio defensively and do not expect high returns. The profile where I make more aggressive investments is my domestic stock profile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I want you to do is to criticize the American stocks that I have chosen, to say their bad aspects. Maybe you know competitors that I do not know, or you think differently from my determinations. Great! I would like to discuss all these with you and enrich my portfolio.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

Keep in mind most of these provide a good quarterly dividend of between $300 and $900+ quarterly. Which do you think we should keep? We retire in 15 years. \n\nPFZ Pfizer\nJNJ Johnson & Johnson\nCVX Chevron\nBP British Petroleum \nPEP Pepsi\nPG Proctor & Gamble\nTSLA Tesla\nAPPL Apple \n\nI\u2019m thinking drop the TSLA. Keep the rest. Reinvest all dividends EXCEPT the oil stocks, which give us $1200/quarter. If it weren\u2019t for the dividends, I\u2019d sell the oil stocks this or next year while they\u2019re still up. \n\nThoughts?",

A news article said that mortgage rates may be over 10 percent in a few months.  And many stocks such as PG, WMT and PEP won't do well if the 10 year U.S. Treasury bonds go well over 4 percent.\n\nIf inflation continues, I wonder if the Fed rates will keep increasing until they reach the rate of inflation, and stocks have a ways to go before they reach bottom.",

        "post_text": "Recession stocks with opportunity for scale? I'm not talking about astronomical growth. However, I think there are some stocks that's good (or neutral) in a recession while also having some upside due to technological advancement or expansion into a new territory.\n\nSome example:\n\n* Costco: People gravitates towards bulk buying and Kirkland brands during tough economic times. However, Costco still has a ton of room to grow. Charlie Munger said Costco can become an online retailer challenger to Amazon.\n\n* Walmart: Walmart is quietly building up their online offerings and delivery service. I personally use their grocery delivery service and it isn't terrible. Maybe 3 to 5 years from now they can be the #2 online retailer after Amazon and Costco.\n\n* LMT: Defense spending is not likely to go down any time soon. Plus LMT also have divisions for space exploration, automation, AI, energy storage, and cybersecurity. The only down side is that this stock is already through the roof due to current Russian aggression.\n\nWould love to hear everyone's picks for \"good in recession with possibility of moderate to great growth\" stocks.",

        "post_text": "Veteran Investors, What Do You Expect? We all know that EVERYONE on reddit started investing over the last 1-2 years, except for the veterans who have been investing since the time of the Pharaohs. Obviously, I can't age limit this post but I am very interested in what long time veterans have to say about this market. Most of us newer investors say we have long timelines but we really haven't been in the public market that long so we don't truly understand what long means yet. We know that history repeats itself but we're also in \"unprecedented territory\" so we're running around like chickens with our heads cut off.\n\nBased on my reading it seems that we are down from all time highs but many still expect the floor to keep dropping out for the next 1-2 years due to the amount of money in circulation. \n\nI am also very curious what people think about manipulation in the markets. It's clear to me that there has always been manipulation but it seems to be especially in vogue at the moment and I am curious if you think this will cause lawmakers to enact significant structural changes, or is this just business as usual?\n\nPersonally, I don't know what to expect so I continue to DCA into individual opportunities I like and I have already maxed out my IRA for the year (half earlier, half recently) even though I do believe the market will continue its disappointing run for the next few years. I just don't see us climbing out of this inflation hole anytime soon, especially with the current geopolitical situation.\n\nCurrently, my best individual stocks are SHW, PG, KO, BMY, T and ANTM. In my IRA my best pick is PDBC.",
