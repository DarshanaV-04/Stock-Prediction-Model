# Stock-Prediction-Model
To extract the data from the reddit,to collect post of users regarding the stock market price prediction by analysing the sentiment of user in three ways:Positive,Negative or Neutral
The code from where data is extracted is mentioned in the stockmarket.ipynb file.The project is fully executed in jupyter notebook.
Things to do befors executing the code:
 Install Jupyter Notebook
pip install praw //to extract data from reddit
 pip install json // to produce the collected data in json format.It is available in reddit_stock_data_final.json file
 pip install yfinance // to get stock related data
 pip install re //for evaluating regex expression

These libraries must be installed to web scrape the data from reddit.

Various Machine learning models are used to give correct accuracy to predict the stock price for future years.
# Gradient Regressor model:Required dependencies which need to be installed are given below
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib 
After installation of all these dependencies,run the code,Enter the required prediction stock symbol and enter the year for which you need the prediction and stock price will be predicted with a graph representing Actual price vs Predicted price
# LSTM Model: Required dependencies which need to be installed are given below
 pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
After installation of all these dependencies,run the code,Enter the required prediction stock symbol and enter the year for which you need the prediction and stock price will be predicted with a graph representing Actual price vs Predicted price
#  Random Forest :Required dependencies which need to be installed are given below
 pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
After installation of all these dependencies,run the code,Enter the required prediction stock symbol and enter the year for which you need the prediction and stock price will be predicted with a graph representing Actual price vs Predicted price
